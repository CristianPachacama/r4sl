While this is the current title, a more appropriate title would be “Machine Learning from the Perspective of a Statistician using R.,” but doesn’t seem as catchy. About This Book This book currently serves as a supplement to An Introduction to Statistical Learning for STAT 432 - Basics of Statistical Learning at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The initial focus of this text was to expand on ISL’s introduction to using R for statistical learning, mostly through adding to and modifying existing code. This text is currently becoming much more self-contained. Why? A very good question considering that the author consider ISL one of the best undergraduate textbooks available, and was one of the driving forces for the creation of STAT 432. However once the course was created, exact control over content became extremely useful. The main focus of this text is to match the needs of students in that course. Some of those needs include: Additional R code examples and explanation Simulation studies Mathematical rigor that matches the background of the readers A book structure that matches the overall structure of the course In other words, this text seeks to replicate the best parts of An Introduction to Statistical Learning, The Elements of Statistical Learning, and Applied Predictive Modeling that are most needed by a particular set of students. Organization The text is organized into roughly seven parts. Prerequisites (Supervised Learning) Regression (Supervised Learning) Classification Unsupervised Learning (Statistical Learning) in Practice (Statistical Learning) in The Modern Era Appendix Part 1 details the assumed prerequisite knowledge required to read the text. It recaps some of the more important bits of information. It is currently rather sparse. Parts 2, 3, and 4 discuss the theory of statistical learning. Several methods are introduced throughout to highlight different theoretical concepts. Parts 5 and 6 highlight the use of statistical learning in practice. Part 5 focuses on practical usage of the techniques seen in Parts 2, 3, and 4. Part 6 introduces techniques that are most commonly used in practice today. Who? This book is targeted at advanced undergraduate or first year MS students in Statistics who have no prior statistical learning experience. While both will be discussed in great detail, previous experience with both statistical modeling and R are assumed. Caveat Emptor This “book” is under active development. Much of the text was hastily written during the Spring 2017 run of the course. While together with ISL the coverage is essentially complete, significant updates are occurring during Fall 2017. When possible, it would be best to always access the text online to be sure you are using the most up-to-date version. Also, the html version provides additional features such as changing text size, font, and colors. If you are in need of a local copy, a pdf version is continuously maintained. While development is taking place, formatting in the pdf version may not be as well planned as the html version since the html version does not need to worry about pagination. Since this book is under active development you may encounter errors ranging from typos, to broken code, to poorly explained topics. If you do, please let us know! Simply send an email and we will make the changes as soon as possible. (dalpiaz2 AT illinois DOT edu) Or, if you know rmarkdown and are familiar with GitHub, make a pull request and fix an issue yourself! This process is partially automated by the edit button in the top-left corner of the html version. If your suggestion or fix becomes part of the book, you will be added to the list at the end of this chapter. We’ll also link to your GitHub account, or personal website upon request. While development is taking place, you may see “TODO” scattered throughout the text. These are mostly notes for internal use, but give the reader some idea of what development is still to come. Conventions This text uses MathJax to render mathematical notation for the web. Occasionally, but rarely, a JavaScript error will prevent MathJax from rendering correctly. In this case, you will see the “code” instead of the expected mathematical equations. From experience, this is almost always fixed by simply refreshing the page. You’ll also notice that if you right-click any equation you can obtain the MathML Code (for copying into Microsoft Word) or the TeX command used to generate the equation. \\[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \\] R code will be typeset using a monospace font which is syntax highlighted. a = 3 b = 4 sqrt(a ^ 2 + b ^ 2) R output lines, which would appear in the console will begin with ##. They will generally not be syntax highlighted. ## [1] 5 Often the symbol \\(\\triangleq\\) will be used to mean “is defined to be.” We use the value \\(p\\) to mean the number of predictors.

As the treatment is less than complete, a list of references is given at the end of the chapter. For example, we ignore the usual recap of basic set theory and omit proofs and examples. 2.1 Probability Models When discussing probability models, we speak of random experiments that produce one of a number of possible outcomes. A probability model that describes the uncertainty of an experiment consists of two elements: The sample space, often denoted as \\(\\Omega\\), which is a set that contains all possible outcomes. A probability function that assigns to an event \\(A\\) a nonnegative number, \\(P[A]\\), that represents how likely it is that event \\(A\\) occurs as a result of the experiment. We call \\(P[A]\\) the probability of event \\(A\\). An event \\(A\\) could be any subset of the sample space, not necessarily a single possible outcome. The probability law must follow a number of rules, which are the result of a set of axioms that we introduce now. 2.2 Probability Axioms Given a sample space \\(\\Omega\\) for a particular experiment, the probability function associated with the experiment must satisfy the following axioms. Nonnegativity: \\(P[A] \\geq 0\\) for any event \\(A \\subset \\Omega\\). Normalization: \\(P[\\Omega] = 1\\). That is, the probability of the entire space is 1. Additivity: For mutually exclusive events \\(E_1, E_2, \\ldots\\) \\[ P\\left[\\bigcup_{i = 1}^{\\infty} E_i\\right] = \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\infty} P[E_i] \\] Using these axioms, many additional probability rules can easily be derived. 2.3 Probability Rules Given an event \\(A\\), and its complement, \\(A^c\\), that is, the outcomes in \\(\\Omega\\) which are not in \\(A\\), we have the complement rule: \\[ P[A^c] = 1 - P[A] \\] In general, for two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we have the addition rule: \\[ P[A \\cup B] = P[A] + P[B] - P[A \\cap B] \\] If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are also disjoint, then we have: \\[ P[A \\cup B] = P[A] + P[B] \\] If we have \\(n\\) mutually exclusive events, \\(E_1, E_2, \\ldots E_n\\), then we have: \\[ P\\left[\\textstyle\\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} E_i\\right] = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} P[E_i] \\] Often, we would like to understand the probability of an event \\(A\\), given some information about the outcome of event \\(B\\). In that case, we have the conditional probability rule provided \\(P[B] &gt; 0\\). \\[ P[A \\mid B] = \\frac{P[A \\cap B]}{P[B]} \\] Rearranging the conditional probability rule, we obtain the multiplication rule: \\[ P[A \\cap B] = P[B] \\cdot P[A \\mid B] \\cdot \\] For a number of events \\(E_1, E_2, \\ldots E_n\\), the multiplication rule can be expanded into the chain rule: \\[ P\\left[\\textstyle\\bigcap_{i = 1}^{n} E_i\\right] = P[E_1] \\cdot P[E_2 \\mid E_1] \\cdot P[E_3 \\mid E_1 \\cap E_2] \\cdots P\\left[E_n \\mid \\textstyle\\bigcap_{i = 1}^{n - 1} E_i\\right] \\] Define a partition of a sample space \\(\\Omega\\) to be a set of disjoint events \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n\\) whose union is the sample space \\(\\Omega\\). That is \\[ A_i \\cap A_j = \\emptyset \\] for all \\(i \\neq j\\), and \\[ \\bigcup_{i = 1}^{n} A_i = \\Omega. \\] Now, let \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_n\\) form a partition of the sample space where \\(P[A_i] &gt; 0\\) for all \\(i\\). Then for any event \\(B\\) with \\(P[B] &gt; 0\\) we have Bayes’ Rule: \\[ P[A_i | B] = \\frac{P[A_i]P[B | A_i]}{P[B]} = \\frac{P[A_i]P[B | A_i]}{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}P[A_i]P[B | A_i]} \\] The denominator of the latter equality is often called the law of total probability: \\[ P[B] = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}P[A_i]P[B | A_i] \\] Two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are said to be independent if they satisfy \\[ P[A \\cap B] = P[A] \\cdot P[B] \\] This becomes the new multiplication rule for independent events. A collection of events \\(E_1, E_2, \\ldots E_n\\) is said to be independent if \\[ P\\left[\\bigcap_{i \\in S} E_i \\right] = \\prod_{i \\in S}P[E_i] \\] for every subset \\(S\\) of \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots n\\}\\). If this is the case, then the chain rule is greatly simplified to: \\[ P\\left[\\textstyle\\bigcap_{i = 1}^{n} E_i\\right] = \\prod_{i=1}^{n}P[E_i] \\] 2.4 Random Variables A random variable is simply a function which maps outcomes in the sample space to real numbers. 2.4.1 Distributions We often talk about the distribution of a random variable, which can be thought of as: \\[ \\text{distribution} = \\text{list of possible} \\textbf{ values} + \\text{associated} \\textbf{ probabilities} \\] This is not a strict mathematical definition, but is useful for conveying the idea. If the possible values of a random variables are discrete, it is called a discrete random variable. If the possible values of a random variables are continuous, it is called a continuous random variable. 2.4.2 Discrete Random Variables The distribution of a discrete random variable \\(X\\) is most often specified by a list of possible values and a probability mass function, \\(p(x)\\). The mass function directly gives probabilities, that is, \\[ p(x) = p_X(x) = P[X = x]. \\] Note we almost always drop the subscript from the more correct \\(p_X(x)\\) and simply refer to \\(p(x)\\). The relevant random variable is discerned from context The most common example of a discrete random variable is a binomial random variable. The mass function of a binomial random variable \\(X\\), is given by \\[ p(x | n, p) = {n \\choose x} p^x(1 - p)^{n - x}, \\ \\ \\ x = 0, 1, \\ldots, n, \\ n \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\ 0 &lt; p &lt; 1. \\] This line conveys a large amount of information. The function \\(p(x | n, p)\\) is the mass function. It is a function of \\(x\\), the possible values of the random variable \\(X\\). It is conditional on the parameters \\(n\\) and \\(p\\). Different values of these parameters specify different binomial distributions. \\(x = 0, 1, \\ldots, n\\) indicates the sample space, that is, the possible values of the random variable. \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(0 &lt; p &lt; 1\\) specify the parameter spaces. These are the possible values of the parameters that give a valid binomial distribution. Often all of this information is simply encoded by writing \\[ X \\sim \\text{bin}(n, p). \\] 2.4.3 Continuous Random Variables The distribution of a continuous random variable \\(X\\) is most often specified by a set of possible values and a probability density function, \\(f(x)\\). (A cumulative density or moment generating function would also suffice.) The probability of the event \\(a &lt; X &lt; b\\) is calculated as \\[ P[a &lt; X &lt; b] = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx. \\] Note that densities are not probabilities. The most common example of a continuous random variable is a normal random variable. The density of a normal random variable \\(X\\), is given by \\[ f(x | \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\cdot \\exp\\left[\\frac{-1}{2} \\left(\\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 \\right], \\ \\ \\ -\\infty &lt; x &lt; \\infty, \\ -\\infty &lt; \\mu &lt; \\infty, \\ \\sigma &gt; 0. \\] The function \\(f(x | \\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) is the density function. It is a function of \\(x\\), the possible values of the random variable \\(X\\). It is conditional on the paramters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). Different values of these parameters specify different normal distributions. \\(-\\infty &lt; x &lt; \\infty\\) indicates the sample space. In this case, the random variable may take any value on the real line. \\(-\\infty &lt; \\mu &lt; \\infty\\) and \\(\\sigma &gt; 0\\) specify the parameter space. These are the possible values of the parameters that give a valid normal distribution. Often all of this information is simply encoded by writing \\[ X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2) \\] 2.4.4 Several Random Variables Consider two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). We say they are independent if \\[ f(x, y) = f(x) \\cdot f(y) \\] for all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Here \\(f(x, y)\\) is the joint density (mass) function of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). We call \\(f(x)\\) the marginal density (mass) function of \\(X\\). Then \\(f(y)\\) the marginal density (mass) function of \\(Y\\). The joint density (mass) function \\(f(x, y)\\) together with the possible \\((x, y)\\) values specify the joint distribution of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Similar notions exist for more than two variables. 2.5 Expectations For discrete random variables, we define the expectation of the function of a random variable \\(X\\) as follows. \\[ \\mathbb{E}[g(X)] \\triangleq \\sum_{x} g(x)p(x) \\] For continuous random variables we have a similar definition. \\[ \\mathbb{E}[g(X)] \\triangleq \\int g(x)f(x) dx \\] For specific functions \\(g\\), expectations are given names. The mean of a random variable \\(X\\) is given by \\[ \\mu_{X} = \\text{mean}[X] \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}[X]. \\] So for a discrete random variable, we would have \\[ \\text{mean}[X] = \\sum_{x} x \\cdot p(x) \\] For a continuous random variable we would simply replace the sum by an integral. The variance of a random variable \\(X\\) is given by \\[ \\sigma^2_{X} = \\text{var}[X] \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mathbb{E}[X])^2] = \\mathbb{E}[X^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[X])^2. \\] The standard deviation of a random variable \\(X\\) is given by \\[ \\sigma_{X} = \\text{sd}[X] \\triangleq \\sqrt{\\sigma^2_{X}} = \\sqrt{\\text{var}[X]}. \\] The covariance of random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is given by \\[ \\text{cov}[X, Y] \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}[(X - \\mathbb{E}[X])(Y - \\mathbb{E}[Y])] = \\mathbb{E}[XY] - \\mathbb{E}[X] \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[Y]. \\] 2.6 Likelihood Consider \\(n\\) iid random variables \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots X_n\\). We can then write their likelihood as \\[ \\mathcal{L}(\\theta \\mid x_1, x_2, \\ldots x_n) = \\prod_{i = i}^n f(x_i; \\theta) \\] where \\(f(x_i; \\theta)\\) is the density (or mass) function of random variable \\(X_i\\) evaluated at \\(x_i\\) with parameter \\(\\theta\\). Whereas a probability is a function of a possible observed value given a particular parameter value, a likelihood is the opposite. It is a function of a possible parameter value given observed data. Maximumizing likelihood is a common techinque for fitting a model to data. 2.7 Videos The YouTube channel mathematicalmonk has a great Probability Primer playlist containing lectures on many fundamental probability concepts.

This chapter will recap the basics of performing regression analyses in R. For more detailed coverage, see Applied Statistics with R. We will use the Advertising data associated with Introduction to Statistical Learning. library(readr) Advertising = read_csv(&quot;data/Advertising.csv&quot;) After loading data into R, our first step should always be to inspect the data. We will start by simply printing some observations in order to understand the basic structure of the data. Advertising ## # A tibble: 200 x 4 ## TV Radio Newspaper Sales ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 230.1 37.8 69.2 22.1 ## 2 44.5 39.3 45.1 10.4 ## 3 17.2 45.9 69.3 9.3 ## 4 151.5 41.3 58.5 18.5 ## 5 180.8 10.8 58.4 12.9 ## 6 8.7 48.9 75.0 7.2 ## 7 57.5 32.8 23.5 11.8 ## 8 120.2 19.6 11.6 13.2 ## 9 8.6 2.1 1.0 4.8 ## 10 199.8 2.6 21.2 10.6 ## # ... with 190 more rows Because the data was read using read_csv(), Advertising is a tibble. We see that there are a total of 200 observations and 4 variables, each of which is numeric. (Specifically double-precision vectors, but more importantly they are numbers.) For the purpose of this analysis, Sales will be the response variable. That is, we seek to understand the relationship between Sales, and the predictor variables: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. 4.1 Visualization for Regression After investigating the structure of the data, the next step should be to visualize the data. Since we have only numeric variables, we should consider scatter plots. We could do so for any individual predictor. plot(Sales ~ TV, data = Advertising, col = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;, pch = 20, cex = 1.5, main = &quot;Sales vs Television Advertising&quot;) The pairs() function is a useful way to quickly visualize a number of scatter plots. pairs(Advertising) Often, we will be most interested in only the relationship between each predictor and the response. For this, we can use the featurePlot() function from the caret package. (We will use the caret package more and more frequently as we introduce new topics.) library(caret) featurePlot(x = Advertising[ , c(&quot;TV&quot;, &quot;Radio&quot;, &quot;Newspaper&quot;)], y = Advertising$Sales) We see that there is a clear increase in Sales as Radio or TV are increased. The relationship between Sales and Newspaper is less clear. How all of the predictors work together is also unclear, as there is some obvious correlation between Radio and TV. To investigate further, we will need to model the data. 4.2 The lm() Function The following code fits an additive linear model with Sales as the response and each remaining variable as a predictor. Note, by not using attach() and instead specifying the data = argument, we are able to specify this model without using each of the variable names directly. mod_1 = lm(Sales ~ ., data = Advertising) # mod_1 = lm(Sales ~ TV + Radio + Newspaper, data = Advertising) Note that the commented line is equivalent to the line that is run, but we will often use the response ~ . syntax when possible. 4.3 Hypothesis Testing The summary() function will return a large amount of useful information about a model fit using lm(). Much of it will be helpful for hypothesis testing including individual tests about each predictor, as well as the significance of the regression test. summary(mod_1) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Sales ~ ., data = Advertising) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -8.8277 -0.8908 0.2418 1.1893 2.8292 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) ## (Intercept) 2.938889 0.311908 9.422 &lt;2e-16 *** ## TV 0.045765 0.001395 32.809 &lt;2e-16 *** ## Radio 0.188530 0.008611 21.893 &lt;2e-16 *** ## Newspaper -0.001037 0.005871 -0.177 0.86 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## ## Residual standard error: 1.686 on 196 degrees of freedom ## Multiple R-squared: 0.8972, Adjusted R-squared: 0.8956 ## F-statistic: 570.3 on 3 and 196 DF, p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16 mod_0 = lm(Sales ~ TV + Radio, data = Advertising) The anova() function is useful for comparing two models. Here we compare the full additive model, mod_1, to a reduced model mod_0. Essentially we are testing for the significance of the Newspaper variable in the additive model. anova(mod_0, mod_1) ## Analysis of Variance Table ## ## Model 1: Sales ~ TV + Radio ## Model 2: Sales ~ TV + Radio + Newspaper ## Res.Df RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F) ## 1 197 556.91 ## 2 196 556.83 1 0.088717 0.0312 0.8599 Note that hypothesis testing is not our focus, so we omit many details. 4.4 Prediction The predict() function is an extremely versatile function, for, prediction. When used on the result of a model fit using lm() it will, by default, return predictions for each of the data points used to fit the model. (Here, we limit the printed result to the first 10.) head(predict(mod_1), n = 10) ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ## 20.523974 12.337855 12.307671 17.597830 13.188672 12.478348 11.729760 ## 8 9 10 ## 12.122953 3.727341 12.550849 Note that the effect of the predict() function is dependent on the input to the function. Here, we are supplying as the first argument a model object of class lm. Because of this, predict() then runs the predict.lm() function. Thus, we should use ?predict.lm() for details. We could also specify new data, which should be a data frame or tibble with the same column names as the predictors. new_obs = data.frame(TV = 150, Radio = 40, Newspaper = 1) We can then use the predict() function for point estimates, confidence intervals, and prediction intervals. Using only the first two arguments, R will simply return a point estimate, that is, the “predicted value,” \\(\\hat{y}\\). predict(mod_1, newdata = new_obs) ## 1 ## 17.34375 If we specify an additional argument interval with a value of &quot;confidence&quot;, R will return a 95% confidence interval for the mean response at the specified point. Note that here R also gives the point estimate as fit. predict(mod_1, newdata = new_obs, interval = &quot;confidence&quot;) ## fit lwr upr ## 1 17.34375 16.77654 17.91096 Lastly, we can alter the level using the level argument. Here we report a prediction interval instead of a confidence interval. predict(mod_1, newdata = new_obs, interval = &quot;prediction&quot;, level = 0.99) ## fit lwr upr ## 1 17.34375 12.89612 21.79138 4.5 Unusual Observations R provides several functions for obtaining metrics related to unusual observations. resid() provides the residual for each observation hatvalues() gives the leverage of each observation rstudent() give the studentized residual for each observation cooks.distance() calculates the influence of each observation head(resid(mod_1), n = 10) ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 1.57602559 -1.93785482 -3.00767078 0.90217049 -0.28867186 -5.27834763 ## 7 8 9 10 ## 0.07024005 1.07704683 1.07265914 -1.95084872 head(hatvalues(mod_1), n = 10) ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 0.025202848 0.019418228 0.039226158 0.016609666 0.023508833 0.047481074 ## 7 8 9 10 ## 0.014435091 0.009184456 0.030714427 0.017147645 head(rstudent(mod_1), n = 10) ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 0.94680369 -1.16207937 -1.83138947 0.53877383 -0.17288663 -3.28803309 ## 7 8 9 10 ## 0.04186991 0.64099269 0.64544184 -1.16856434 head(cooks.distance(mod_1), n = 10) ## 1 2 3 4 5 ## 5.797287e-03 6.673622e-03 3.382760e-02 1.230165e-03 1.807925e-04 ## 6 7 8 9 10 ## 1.283058e-01 6.452021e-06 9.550237e-04 3.310088e-03 5.945006e-03 4.6 Adding Complexity We have a number of ways to add complexity to a linear model, even allowing a linear model to be used to model non-linear relationships. 4.6.1 Interactions Interactions can be introduced to the lm() procedure in a number of ways.

Categorical predictors are often recorded as factor variables in R. library(tibble) cat_pred = tibble( x1 = factor(c(rep(&quot;A&quot;, 10), rep(&quot;B&quot;, 10), rep(&quot;C&quot;, 10))), x2 = runif(n = 30), y = rnorm(n = 30) ) cat_pred ## # A tibble: 30 x 3 ## x1 x2 y ## &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 A 0.19350140 -0.44464801 ## 2 A 0.65431461 -1.94771100 ## 3 A 0.81855610 0.99728222 ## 4 A 0.24025990 0.49835896 ## 5 A 0.76971530 -0.73374137 ## 6 A 0.08858107 0.54059598 ## 7 A 0.62759101 0.35477724 ## 8 A 0.78208892 -0.09501047 ## 9 A 0.49396410 0.81249071 ## 10 A 0.75315890 -0.14729529 ## # ... with 20 more rows Notice that in this simple simulated tibble, we have coerced x1 to be a factor variable, although this is not strictly necessary since the variable took values A, B, and C. When using lm(), even if not a factor, R would have treated x1 as such. Coercion to factor is more important if a categorical variable is coded for example as 1, 2 and 3. Otherwise it is treated as numeric, which creates a difference in the regression model.

Be aware, when doing so to the response variable, that this will affect the units of said variable.

The next chapter will illustrate them by example. Note: This is a placeholder chapter that is new. Supervised Learning Regression (Numeric Response) What do we want? To make predictions on unseen data. (Predicting on data we already have is easy…) In other words, we want a model that generalizes well. That is, generalizes to unseen data. How we will do this? By controlling the complexity of the model to guard against overfitting and underfitting. Model Parameters Tuning Parameters Why does manipulating the model complexity accomplish this? Because there is a bias-variance tradeoff. How do we know if our model generalizes? By evaluating metrics on test data. We will only ever fit (train) models on training data. All analyses will begin with a test-train split. For regression tasks, our metric will be RMSE. Classification (Categorical Response) The next section. Regression is a form of supervised learning. Supervised learning deals with problems where there are both an input and an output. Regression problems are the subset of supervised learning problems with a numeric output. Often one of the biggest differences between statistical learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence are the names used to describe variables and methods. The input can be called: input vector, feature vector, or predictors. The elements of these would be an input, feature, or predictor. The individual features can be either numeric or categorical. The output may be called: output, response, outcome, or target. The response must be numeric. As an aside, some textbooks and statisticians use the terms independent and dependent variables to describe the response and the predictors. However, this practice can be confusing as those terms have specific meanings in probability theory. Our goal is to find a rule, algorithm, or function which takes as input a feature vector, and outputs a response which is as close to the true value as possible. We often write the true, unknown relationship between the input and output \\(f(\\bf{x})\\). The relationship (model) we learn (fit, train), based on data, is written \\(\\hat{f}(\\bf{x})\\). From a statistical learning point-of-view, we write, \\[ Y = f(\\bf{x}) + \\epsilon \\] to indicate that the true response is a function of both the unknown relationship, as well as some unlearnable noise. \\[ \\text{RMSE}(\\hat{f}, \\text{Data}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\left(y_i - \\hat{f}(\\bf{x}_i)\\right)^2} \\] \\[ \\text{RMSE}_{\\text{Train}} = \\text{RMSE}(\\hat{f}, \\text{Train Data}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{\\text{Tr}}}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i \\in \\text{Train}}^{}\\left(y_i - \\hat{f}(\\bf{x}_i)\\right)^2} \\] \\[ \\text{RMSE}_{\\text{Test}} = \\text{RMSE}(\\hat{f}, \\text{Test Data}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{\\text{Te}}}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i \\in \\text{Test}}^{}\\left(y_i - \\hat{f}(\\bf{x}_i)\\right)^2} \\] - TODO: RSS vs \\(R^2\\) vs RMSE 5.1 Regression Notation \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) = \\(n \\times p\\) data matrix \\(\\mathbf{x}_j\\) = column of data matrix. vector of length \\(n\\). \\(n\\) observations of predictors \\(j\\). \\(X\\) = random variable. vector of length \\(p\\), which could be 1 (not bold) \\(x_i\\) = predictor values for observation \\(i\\). vector of length \\(p\\). realization of random variable \\(X\\).

Move some specifics to following chapter on use of linear models. NOTE: This chapter has previously existed. Eventually the concepts will be first introduced in the preceding chapter. When using linear models in the past, we often emphasized distributional results, which were useful for creating and performing hypothesis tests. Frequently, when developing a linear regression model, part of our goal was to explain a relationship. Now, we will ignore much of what we have learned and instead simply use regression as a tool to predict. Instead of a model which explains relationships, we seek a model which minimizes errors. First, note that a linear model is one of many methods used in regression. To discuss linear models in the context of prediction, we return to the Advertising data from the previous chapter. Advertising ## # A tibble: 200 x 4 ## TV Radio Newspaper Sales ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 230.1 37.8 69.2 22.1 ## 2 44.5 39.3 45.1 10.4 ## 3 17.2 45.9 69.3 9.3 ## 4 151.5 41.3 58.5 18.5 ## 5 180.8 10.8 58.4 12.9 ## 6 8.7 48.9 75.0 7.2 ## 7 57.5 32.8 23.5 11.8 ## 8 120.2 19.6 11.6 13.2 ## 9 8.6 2.1 1.0 4.8 ## 10 199.8 2.6 21.2 10.6 ## # ... with 190 more rows library(caret) featurePlot(x = Advertising[ , c(&quot;TV&quot;, &quot;Radio&quot;, &quot;Newspaper&quot;)], y = Advertising$Sales) 6.1 Assesing Model Accuracy There are many metrics to assess the accuracy of a regression model. Most of these measure in some way the average error that the model makes. The metric that we will be most interested in is the root-mean-square error. \\[ \\text{RMSE}(\\hat{f}, \\text{Data}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\left(y_i - \\hat{f}(\\bf{x}_i)\\right)^2} \\] While for the sake of comparing models, the choice between RMSE and MSE is arbitrary, we have a preference for RMSE, as it has the same units as the response variable. Also, notice that in the prediction context MSE refers to an average, whereas in an ANOVA context, the denominator for MSE may not be \\(n\\). For a linear model , the estimate of \\(f\\), \\(\\hat{f}\\), is given by the fitted regression line. \\[ \\hat{y}(\\bf{x}_i) = \\hat{f}(\\bf{x}_i) \\] We can write an R function that will be useful for performing this calculation. rmse = function(actual, predicted) { sqrt(mean((actual - predicted) ^ 2)) } 6.2 Model Complexity Aside from how well a model predicts, we will also be very interested in the complexity (flexibility) of a model. For now, we will only considered nested linear models for simplicity. Then in that case, the more predictors that a model has, the more complex the model. For the sake of assigning a numerical value to the complexity of a linear model, we will use the number of predictors, \\(p\\). We write a simple R function to extract this information from a model. get_complexity = function(model) { length(coef(model)) - 1 } 6.3 Test-Train Split There is an issue with fitting a model to all available data then using RMSE to determine how well the model predicts. It is essentially cheating! As a linear model becomes more complex, the RSS, thus RMSE, can never go up. It will only go down, or in very specific cases, stay the same. This would suggest that to predict well, we should use the largest possible model! However, in reality we have hard fit to a specific dataset, but as soon as we see new data, a large model may in fact predict poorly. This is called overfitting. Frequently we will take a dataset of interest and split it in two. One part of the datasets will be used to fit (train) a model, which we will call the training data. The remainder of the original data will be used to assess how well the model is predicting, which we will call the test data. Test data should never be used to train a model. Note that sometimes the terms evaluation set and test set are used interchangeably. We will give somewhat specific definitions to these later. For now we will simply use a single test set for a training set. Here we use the sample() function to obtain a random sample of the rows of the original data. We then use those row numbers (and remaining row numbers) to split the data accordingly. Notice we used the set.seed() function to allow use to reproduce the same random split each time we perform this analysis. set.seed(9) num_obs = nrow(Advertising) train_index = sample(num_obs, size = trunc(0.50 * num_obs)) train_data = Advertising[train_index, ] test_data = Advertising[-train_index, ] We will look at two measures that assess how well a model is predicting, the train RMSE and the test RMSE. \\[ \\text{RMSE}_{\\text{Train}} = \\text{RMSE}(\\hat{f}, \\text{Train Data}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{\\text{Tr}}}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i \\in \\text{Train}}^{}\\left(y_i - \\hat{f}(\\bf{x}_i)\\right)^2} \\] Here \\(n_{Tr}\\) is the number of observations in the train set. Train RMSE will still always go down (or stay the same) as the complexity of a linear model increases. That means train RMSE will not be useful for comparing models, but checking that it decreases is a useful sanity check. \\[ \\text{RMSE}_{\\text{Test}} = \\text{RMSE}(\\hat{f}, \\text{Test Data}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_{\\text{Te}}}\\displaystyle\\sum_{i \\in \\text{Test}}^{}\\left(y_i - \\hat{f}(\\bf{x}_i)\\right)^2} \\] Here \\(n_{Te}\\) is the number of observations in the test set. Test RMSE uses the model fit to the training data, but evaluated on the unused test data. This is a measure of how well the fitted model will predict in general, not simply how well it fits data used to train the model, as is the case with train RMSE. What happens to test RMSE as the size of the model increases? That is what we will investigate. We will start with the simplest possible linear model, that is, a model with no predictors. fit_0 = lm(Sales ~ 1, data = train_data) get_complexity(fit_0) ## [1] 0 # train RMSE sqrt(mean((train_data$Sales - predict(fit_0, train_data)) ^ 2)) ## [1] 4.788513 # test RMSE sqrt(mean((test_data$Sales - predict(fit_0, test_data)) ^ 2)) ## [1] 5.643574 The previous two operations obtain the train and test RMSE. Since these are operations we are about to use repeatedly, we should use the function that we happen to have already written. # train RMSE rmse(actual = train_data$Sales, predicted = predict(fit_0, train_data)) ## [1] 4.788513 # test RMSE rmse(actual = test_data$Sales, predicted = predict(fit_0, test_data)) ## [1] 5.643574 This function can actually be improved for the inputs that we are using. We would like to obtain train and test RMSE for a fitted model, given a train or test dataset, and the appropriate response variable. get_rmse = function(model, data, response) { rmse(actual = data[, response], predicted = predict(model, data)) } By using this function, our code becomes easier to read, and it is more obvious what task we are accomplishing. get_rmse(model = fit_0, data = train_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) # train RMSE ## [1] 4.788513 get_rmse(model = fit_0, data = test_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) # test RMSE ## [1] 5.643574 6.4 Adding Flexibility to Linear Models Each successive model we fit will be more and more flexible using both interactions and polynomial terms. We will see the training error decrease each time the model is made more flexible. We expect the test error to decrease a number of times, then eventually start going up, as a result of overfitting. fit_1 = lm(Sales ~ ., data = train_data) get_complexity(fit_1) ## [1] 3 get_rmse(model = fit_1, data = train_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) # train RMSE ## [1] 1.637699 get_rmse(model = fit_1, data = test_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) # test RMSE ## [1] 1.737574 fit_2 = lm(Sales ~ Radio * Newspaper * TV, data = train_data) get_complexity(fit_2) ## [1] 7 get_rmse(model = fit_2, data = train_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) # train RMSE ## [1] 0.7797226 get_rmse(model = fit_2, data = test_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) # test RMSE ## [1] 1.110372 fit_3 = lm(Sales ~ Radio * Newspaper * TV + I(TV ^ 2), data = train_data) get_complexity(fit_3) ## [1] 8 get_rmse(model = fit_3, data = train_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) # train RMSE ## [1] 0.4960149 get_rmse(model = fit_3, data = test_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) # test RMSE ## [1] 0.7320758 fit_4 = lm(Sales ~ Radio * Newspaper * TV + I(TV ^ 2) + I(Radio ^ 2) + I(Newspaper ^ 2), data = train_data) get_complexity(fit_4) ## [1] 10 get_rmse(model = fit_4, data = train_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) # train RMSE ## [1] 0.488771 get_rmse(model = fit_4, data = test_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) # test RMSE ## [1] 0.7466312 fit_5 = lm(Sales ~ Radio * Newspaper * TV + I(TV ^ 2) * I(Radio ^ 2) * I(Newspaper ^ 2), data = train_data) get_complexity(fit_5) ## [1] 14 get_rmse(model = fit_5, data = train_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) # train RMSE ## [1] 0.4705201 get_rmse(model = fit_5, data = test_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) # test RMSE ## [1] 0.8425384 6.5 Choosing a Model To better understand the relationship between train RMSE, test RMSE, and model complexity, we summarize our results, as the above is somewhat cluttered. First, we recap the models that we have fit. fit_1 = lm(Sales ~ ., data = train_data) fit_2 = lm(Sales ~ Radio * Newspaper * TV, data = train_data) fit_3 = lm(Sales ~ Radio * Newspaper * TV + I(TV ^ 2), data = train_data) fit_4 = lm(Sales ~ Radio * Newspaper * TV + I(TV ^ 2) + I(Radio ^ 2) + I(Newspaper ^ 2), data = train_data) fit_5 = lm(Sales ~ Radio * Newspaper * TV + I(TV ^ 2) * I(Radio ^ 2) * I(Newspaper ^ 2), data = train_data) Next, we create a list of the models fit. model_list = list(fit_1, fit_2, fit_3, fit_4, fit_5) We then obtain train RMSE, test RMSE, and model complexity for each. train_rmse = sapply(model_list, get_rmse, data = train_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) test_rmse = sapply(model_list, get_rmse, data = test_data, response = &quot;Sales&quot;) model_complexity = sapply(model_list, get_complexity) We then plot the results. The train RMSE can be seen in blue, while the test RMSE is given in orange. plot(model_complexity, train_rmse, type = &quot;b&quot;, ylim = c(min(c(train_rmse, test_rmse)) - 0.02, max(c(train_rmse, test_rmse)) + 0.02), col = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;, xlab = &quot;Model Size&quot;, ylab = &quot;RMSE&quot;) lines(model_complexity, test_rmse, type = &quot;b&quot;, col = &quot;darkorange&quot;) We also summarize the results as a table. fit_1 is the least flexible, and fit_5 is the most flexible. We see the Train RMSE decrease as flexibility increases. We see that the Test RMSE is smallest for fit_3, thus is the model we believe will perform the best on future data not used to train the model. Note this may not be the best model, but it is the best model of the models we have seen in this example. Model Train RMSE Test RMSE Predictors fit_1 1.6376991 1.7375736 3 fit_2 0.7797226 1.1103716 7 fit_3 0.4960149 0.7320758 8 fit_4 0.488771 0.7466312 10 fit_5 0.4705201 0.8425384 14 To summarize: Underfitting models: In general High Train RMSE, High Test RMSE. Seen in fit_1 and fit_2. Overfitting models: In general Low Train RMSE, High Test RMSE. Seen in fit_4 and fit_5. Specifically, we say that a model is overfitting if there exists a less complex model with lower Test RMSE. Then a model is underfitting if there exists a more complex model with lower Test RMSE. A number of notes on these results: The labels of under and overfitting are relative to the best model we see, fit_3. Any model more complex with higher Test RMSE is overfitting. Any model less complex with higher Test RMSE is underfitting. The train RMSE is guaranteed to follow this non-increasing pattern. The same is not true of test RMSE. Here we see a nice U-shaped curve. There are theoretical reasons why we should expect this, but that is on average. Because of the randomness of one test-train split, we may not always see this result. Re-perform this analysis with a different seed value and the pattern may not hold. We will discuss why we expect this next chapter. We will discuss how we can help create this U-shape much later. Often we expect train RMSE to be lower than test RMSE. Again, due to the randomness of the split, you may get lucky and this will not be true. A final note on the analysis performed here; we paid no attention whatsoever to the “assumptions” of a linear model. We only sought a model that predicted well, and paid no attention to a model for explaination. Hypothesis testing did not play a role in deciding the model, only prediction accuracy. Collinearity? We don’t care. Assumptions? Still don’t care. Diagnostics? Never heard of them. (These statements are a little over the top, and not completely true, but just to drive home the point that we only care about prediction. Often we latch onto methods that we have seen before, even when they are not needed.) "],

Notice that, we do not load this package, but instead use FNN::knn.reg to access the function.

We would like to “predict” \\(Y\\) with some function of \\(X\\), say, \\(f(X)\\). To clarify what we mean by “predict,” we specify that we would like \\(f(X)\\) to be “close” to \\(Y\\). To further clarify what we mean by “close,” we define the squared error loss of estimating \\(Y\\) using \\(f(X)\\). \\[ L(Y, f(X)) \\triangleq (Y - f(X)) ^ 2 \\] Now we can clarify the goal of regression, which is to minimize the above loss, on average. We call this the risk of estimating \\(Y\\) using \\(f(X)\\). \\[ R(Y, f(X)) \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}[L(Y, f(X))] = \\mathbb{E}_{X, Y}[(Y - f(X)) ^ 2] \\] Before attempting to minimize the risk, we first re-write the risk after conditioning on \\(X\\). \\[ \\mathbb{E}_{X, Y} \\left[ (Y - f(X)) ^ 2 \\right] = \\mathbb{E}_{X} \\mathbb{E}_{Y \\mid X} \\left[ ( Y - f(X) ) ^ 2 \\mid X = x \\right] \\] Minimizing the right-hand side is much easier, as it simply amounts to minimizing the inner expectation with respect to \\(Y \\mid X\\), essentially minimizing the risk pointwise, for each \\(x\\). It turns out, that the risk is minimized by the conditional mean of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\), \\[ f(x) = \\mathbb{E}(Y \\mid X = x) \\] which we call the regression function. Note that the choice of squared error loss is somewhat arbitrary. Suppose instead we chose absolute error loss. \\[ L(Y, f(X)) \\triangleq | Y - f(X) | \\] The risk would then be minimized by the conditional median. \\[ f(x) = \\text{median}(Y \\mid X = x) \\] Despite this possibility, our preference will still be for squared error loss. The reasons for this are numerous, including: historical, ease of optimization, and protecting against large deviations. Now, given data \\(\\mathcal{D} = (x_i, y_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^p \\times \\mathbb{R}\\), our goal becomes finding some \\(\\hat{f}\\) that is a good estimate of the regression function \\(f\\). We’ll see that this amounts to minimizing what we call the reducible error. 8.1 Reducible and Irreducible Error Suppose that we obtain some \\(\\hat{f}\\), how well does it estimate \\(f\\)? We define the expected prediction error of predicting \\(Y\\) using \\(\\hat{f}(X)\\). A good \\(\\hat{f}\\) will have a low expected prediction error. \\[ \\text{EPE}\\left(Y, \\hat{f}(X)\\right) \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}_{X, Y, \\mathcal{D}} \\left[ \\left( Y - \\hat{f}(X) \\right)^2 \\right] \\] This expectation is over \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and also \\(\\mathcal{D}\\). The estimate \\(\\hat{f}\\) is actually random depending on the sampled data \\(\\mathcal{D}\\). We could actually write \\(\\hat{f}(X, \\mathcal{D})\\) to make this dependence explicit, but our notation will become cumbersome enough as it is. Like before, we’ll condition on \\(X\\). This results in the expected prediction error of predicting \\(Y\\) using \\(\\hat{f}(X)\\) when \\(X = x\\). \\[ \\text{EPE}\\left(Y, \\hat{f}(x)\\right) = \\mathbb{E}_{Y \\mid X, \\mathcal{D}} \\left[ \\left(Y - \\hat{f}(X) \\right)^2 \\mid X = x \\right] = \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{D}} \\left[ \\left(f(x) - \\hat{f}(x) \\right)^2 \\right]}_\\textrm{reducible error} + \\underbrace{\\mathbb{V}_{Y \\mid X} \\left[ Y \\mid X = x \\right]}_\\textrm{irreducible error} \\] A number of things to note here: The expected prediction error is for a random \\(Y\\) given a fixed \\(x\\) and a random \\(\\hat{f}\\). As such, the expectation is over \\(Y \\mid X\\) and \\(\\mathcal{D}\\). Our estimated function \\(\\hat{f}\\) is random depending on the sampled data, \\(\\mathcal{D}\\), which is used to perform the estimation. The expected prediction error of predicting \\(Y\\) using \\(\\hat{f}(X)\\) when \\(X = x\\) has been decomposed into two errors: The reducible error, which is the expected squared error loss of estimation \\(f(x)\\) using \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) at a fixed point \\(x\\). The only thing that is random here is \\(\\mathcal{D}\\), the data used to obtain \\(\\hat{f}\\). (Both \\(f\\) and \\(x\\) are fixed.) We’ll often call this reducible error the mean squared error of estimating \\(f(x)\\) using \\(\\hat{f}\\) at a fixed point \\(x\\). \\[ \\text{MSE}\\left(f(x), \\hat{f}(x)\\right) \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{D}} \\left[ \\left(f(x) - \\hat{f}(x) \\right)^2 \\right]\\] The irreducible error. This is simply the variance of \\(Y\\) given that \\(X = x\\), essentially noise that we do not want to learn. This is also called the Bayes error. As the name suggests, the reducible error is the error that we have some control over. But how do we control this error? 8.2 Bias-Variance Decomposition After decomposing the expected prediction error into reducible and irreducible error, we can further decompose the reducible error. Recall the definition of the bias of an estimator. \\[ \\text{bias}(\\hat{\\theta}) \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\hat{\\theta}\\right] - \\theta \\] Also recall the definition of the variance of an estimator. \\[ \\mathbb{V}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\text{var}(\\hat{\\theta}) \\triangleq \\mathbb{E}\\left [ ( \\hat{\\theta} -\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\hat{\\theta}\\right] )^2 \\right] \\] Using this, we further decompose the reducible error (mean squared error) into bias squared and variance. \\[ \\text{MSE}\\left(f(x), \\hat{f}(x)\\right) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathcal{D}} \\left[ \\left(f(x) - \\hat{f}(x) \\right)^2 \\right] = \\underbrace{\\left(f(x) - \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\hat{f}(x) \\right] \\right)^2}_{\\text{bias}^2 \\left(\\hat{f}(x) \\right)} + \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\left( \\hat{f}(x) - \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\hat{f}(x) \\right] \\right)^2 \\right]}_{\\text{var} \\left(\\hat{f}(x) \\right)} \\] This is actually a common fact in estimation theory, but we have stated it here specifically for estimation of some regression function \\(f\\) using \\(\\hat{f}\\) at some point \\(x\\). \\[ \\text{MSE}\\left(f(x), \\hat{f}(x)\\right) = \\text{bias}^2 \\left(\\hat{f}(x) \\right) + \\text{var} \\left(\\hat{f}(x) \\right) \\] In a perfect world, we would be able to find some \\(\\hat{f}\\) which is unbiased, that is \\(\\text{bias}\\left(\\hat{f}(x) \\right) = 0\\), which also has low variance. In practice, this isn’t always possible. It turns out, there is a bias-variance tradeoff. That is, often, the more bias in our estimation, the lesser the variance. Similarly, less variance is often accompanied by more bias. Complex models tend to be unbiased, but highly variable. Simple models are often extremely biased, but have low variance. In the context of regression, models are biased when: Parametric: The form of the model does not incorporate all the necessary variables, or the form of the relationship is too simple. For example, a parametric model assumes a linear relationship, but the true relationship is quadratic. Non-parametric: The model provides too much smoothing. In the context of regression, models are variable when: Parametric: The form of the model incorporates too many variables, or the form of the relationship is too complex. For example, a parametric model assumes a cubic relationship, but the true relationship is linear. Non-parametric: The model does not provide enough smoothing. It is very, “wiggly.” So for us, to select a model that appropriately balances the tradeoff between bias and variance, and thus minimizes the reducible error, we need to select a model of the appropriate complexity for the data. Recall that when fitting models, we’ve seen that train RMSE decreases as model complexity is increasing. (Technically it is non-increasing.) For test RMSE, we expect to see a U-shaped curve. Importantly, test RMSE decreases, until a certain complexity, then begins to increase. Now we can understand why this is happening. The expected test RMSE is essentially the expected prediction error, which we now known decomposes into (squared) bias, variance, and the irreducible Bayes error. The following plots show three examples of this. The three plots show three examples of the bias-variance tradeoff. In the left panel, the variance influences the expected prediction error more than the bias. In the right panel, the opposite is true. The middle panel is somewhat neutral. In all cases, the difference between the Bayes error (the horizontal dashed grey line) and the expected prediction error (the solid black curve) is exactly the mean squared error, which is the sum of the squared bias (blue curve) and variance (orange curve). The vertical line indicates the complexity that minimizes the prediction error. To summarize, if we assume that irreducible error can be written as \\[ \\mathbb{V}[Y \\mid X = x] = \\sigma ^ 2 \\] then we can write the full decomposition of the expected prediction error of predicting \\(Y\\) using \\(\\hat{f}\\) when \\(X = x\\) as \\[ \\text{EPE}\\left(Y, \\hat{f}(x)\\right) = \\underbrace{\\text{bias}^2\\left(\\hat{f}(x)\\right) + \\text{var}\\left(\\hat{f}(x)\\right)}_\\textrm{reducible error} + \\sigma^2. \\] As model complexity increases, bias decreases, while variance increases. By understanding the tradeoff between bias and variance, we can manipulate model complexity to find a model that well predict well on unseen observations. 8.3 Simulation We will illustrate these decompositions, most importantly the bias-variance tradeoff, through simulation. Suppose we would like to train a model to learn the true regression function function \\(f(x) = x^2\\). f = function(x) { x ^ 2 } More specifically, we’d like to predict an observation, \\(Y\\), given that \\(X = x\\) by using \\(\\hat{f}(x)\\) where \\[ \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X = x] = f(x) = x^2 \\] and \\[ \\mathbb{V}[Y \\mid X = x] = \\sigma ^ 2. \\] Alternatively, we could write this as \\[ Y = f(X) + \\epsilon \\] where \\(\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon] = 0\\) and \\(\\mathbb{V}[\\epsilon] = \\sigma ^ 2\\). In this formulation, we call \\(f(X)\\) the signal and \\(\\epsilon\\) the noise. To carry out a concrete simulation example, we need to fully specify the data generating process. We do so with the following R code. get_sim_data = function(f, sample_size = 100) { x = runif(n = sample_size, min = 0, max = 1) y = rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = f(x), sd = 0.3) data.frame(x, y) } Also note that if you prefer to think of this situation using the \\(Y = f(X) + \\epsilon\\) formulation, the following code represents the same data generating process. get_sim_data = function(f, sample_size = 100) { x = runif(n = sample_size, min = 0, max = 1) eps = rnorm(n = sample_size, mean = 0, sd = 0.75) y = f(x) + eps data.frame(x, y) } To completely specify the data generating process, we have made more model assumptions than simply \\(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X = x] = x^2\\) and \\(\\mathbb{V}[Y \\mid X = x] = \\sigma ^ 2\\). In particular, The \\(x_i\\) in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) are sampled from a uniform distribution over \\([0, 1]\\). The \\(x_i\\) and \\(\\epsilon\\) are independent. The \\(y_i\\) in \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) are sampled from the conditional normal distribution. \\[ Y \\mid X \\sim N(f(x), \\sigma^2) \\] Using this setup, we will generate datasets, \\(\\mathcal{D}\\), with a sample size \\(n = 100\\) and fit four models. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\texttt{predict(fit0, x)} &amp;= \\hat{f}_0(x) = \\hat{\\beta}_0\\\\ \\texttt{predict(fit1, x)} &amp;= \\hat{f}_1(x) = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x \\\\ \\texttt{predict(fit2, x)} &amp;= \\hat{f}_2(x) = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x + \\hat{\\beta}_2 x^2 \\\\ \\texttt{predict(fit9, x)} &amp;= \\hat{f}_9(x) = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x + \\hat{\\beta}_2 x^2 + \\ldots + \\hat{\\beta}_9 x^9 \\end{aligned} \\] To get a sense of the data and these four models, we generate one simulated dataset, and fit the four models. set.seed(1) sim_data = get_sim_data(f) fit_0 = lm(y ~ 1, data = sim_data) fit_1 = lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 1), data = sim_data) fit_2 = lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 2), data = sim_data) fit_9 = lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 9), data = sim_data) Note that technically we’re being lazy and using orthogonal polynomials, but the fitted values are the same, so this makes no difference for our purposes. Plotting these four trained models, we see that the zero predictor model does very poorly. The first degree model is reasonable, but we can see that the second degree model fits much better. The ninth degree model seem rather wild. The following three plots were created using three additional simulated datasets. The zero predictor and ninth degree polynomial were fit to each. This plot should make clear the difference between the bias and variance of these two models. The zero predictor model is clearly wrong, that is, biased, but nearly the same for each of the datasets, since it has very low variance. While the ninth degree model doesn’t appear to be correct for any of these three simulations, we’ll see that on average it is, and thus is performing unbiased estimation. These plots do however clearly illustrate that the ninth degree polynomial is extremely variable. Each dataset results in a very different fitted model. Correct on average isn’t the only goal we’re after, since in practice, we’ll only have a single dataset. This is why we’d also like our models to exhibit low variance. We could have also fit \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors models to these three datasets. Here we see that when \\(k = 100\\) we have a biased model with very low variance. (It’s actually the same as the 0 predictor linear model.) When \\(k = 5\\), we again have a highly variable model. These two sets of plots reinforce our intuition about the bias-variance tradeoff. Complex models (ninth degree polynomial and \\(k\\) = 5) are highly variable, and often unbiased. Simple models (zero predictor linear model and \\(k = 100\\)) are very biased, but have extremely low variance. We will now complete a simulation study to understand the relationship between the bias, variance, and mean squared error for the estimates for \\(f(x)\\) given by these four models at the point \\(x = 0.90\\). We use simulation to complete this task, as performing the analytical calculations would prove to be rather tedious and difficult. set.seed(1) n_sims = 250 n_models = 4 x = data.frame(x = 0.90) # fixed point at which we make predictions predictions = matrix(0, nrow = n_sims, ncol = n_models) for(sim in 1:n_sims) { # simulate new, random, training data # this is the only random portion of the bias, var, and mse calculations # this allows us to calculate the expectation over D sim_data = get_sim_data(f) # fit models fit_0 = lm(y ~ 1, data = sim_data) fit_1 = lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 1), data = sim_data) fit_2 = lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 2), data = sim_data) fit_9 = lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 9), data = sim_data) # get predictions predictions[sim, 1] = predict(fit_0, x) predictions[sim, 2] = predict(fit_1, x) predictions[sim, 3] = predict(fit_2, x) predictions[sim, 4] = predict(fit_9, x) } Note that this is one of many ways we could have accomplished this task using R. For example we could have used a combination of replicate() and *apply() functions. Alternatively, we could have used a tidyverse approach, which likely would have used some combination of dplyr, tidyr, and purrr. Our approach, which would be considered a base R approach, was chosen to make it as clear as possible what is being done. The tidyverse approach is rapidly gaining popularity in the R community, but might make it more difficult to see what is happening here, unless you are already familiar with that approach. Also of note, while it may seem like the output stored in predictions would meet the definition of tidy data given by Hadley Wickham since each row represents a simulation, it actually falls slightly short. For our data to be tidy, a row should store the simulation number, the model, and the resulting prediction. We’ve actually already aggregated one level above this. Our observational unit is a simulation (with four predictions), but for tidy data, it should be a single prediction. This may be revised by the author later when there are more examples of how to do this from the R community. The above plot shows the predictions for each of the 250 simulations of each of the four models of different polynomial degrees. The truth, \\(f(x = 0.90) = (0.9)^2 = 0.81\\), is given by the solid black horizontal line. Two things are immediately clear: As complexity increases, bias decreases. (The mean of a model’s predictions is closer to the truth.) As complexity increases, variance increases. (The variance about the mean of a model’s predictions increases.) The goal of this simulation study is to show that the following holds true for each of the four models. \\[ \\text{MSE}\\left(f(0.90), \\hat{f}_k(0.90)\\right) = \\underbrace{\\left(\\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\hat{f}_k(0.90) \\right] - f(0.90) \\right)^2}_{\\text{bias}^2 \\left(\\hat{f}_k(0.90) \\right)} + \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\left( \\hat{f}_k(0.90) - \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\hat{f}_k(0.90) \\right] \\right)^2 \\right]}_{\\text{var} \\left(\\hat{f}_k(0.90) \\right)} \\] We’ll use the empirical results of our simulations to estimate these quantities. (Yes, we’re using estimation to justify facts about estimation.) Note that we’ve actually used a rather small number of simulations. In practice we should use more, but for the sake of computation time, we’ve performed just enough simulations to obtain the desired results. (Since we’re estimating estimation, the bigger the sample size, the better.) To estimate the mean squared error of our predictions, we’ll use \\[ \\widehat{\\text{MSE}}\\left(f(0.90), \\hat{f}_k(0.90)\\right) = \\frac{1}{n_{\\texttt{sims}}}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n_{\\texttt{sims}}} \\left(f(0.90) - \\hat{f}_k(0.90) \\right)^2 \\] We also write an accompanying R function. get_mse = function(truth, estimate) { mean((estimate - truth) ^ 2) } Similarly, for the bias of our predictions we use, \\[ \\widehat{\\text{bias}} \\left(\\hat{f}(0.90) \\right) = \\frac{1}{n_{\\texttt{sims}}}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n_{\\texttt{sims}}} \\left(\\hat{f}_k(0.90) \\right) - f(0.90) \\] And again, we write an accompanying R function. get_bias = function(estimate, truth) { mean(estimate) - truth } Lastly, for the variance of our predictions we have \\[ \\widehat{\\text{var}} \\left(\\hat{f}(0.90) \\right) = \\frac{1}{n_{\\texttt{sims}}}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n_{\\texttt{sims}}} \\left(\\hat{f}_k(0.90) - \\frac{1}{n_{\\texttt{sims}}}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n_{\\texttt{sims}}}\\hat{f}_k(0.90) \\right)^2 \\] While there is already R function for variance, the following is more appropriate in this situation. get_var = function(estimate) { mean((estimate - mean(estimate)) ^ 2) } To quickly obtain these results for each of the four models, we utilize the apply() function. bias = apply(predictions, 2, get_bias, truth = f(x = 0.90)) variance = apply(predictions, 2, get_var) mse = apply(predictions, 2, get_mse, truth = f(x = 0.90)) We summarize these results in the following table. Degree Mean Squared Error Bias Squared Variance 0 0.22643 0.22476 0.00167 1 0.00829 0.00508 0.00322 2 0.00387 0.00005 0.00381 9 0.01019 0.00002 0.01017 A number of things to notice here: We use squared bias in this table. Since bias can be positive or negative, squared bias is more useful for observing the trend as complexity increases. The squared bias trend which we see here is decreasing as complexity increases, which we expect to see in general. The exact opposite is true of variance. As model complexity increases, variance increases. The mean squared error, which is a function of the bias and variance, decreases, then increases. This is a result of the bias-variance tradeoff. We can decrease bias, by increasing variance. Or, we can decrease variance by increasing bias. By striking the correct balance, we can find a good mean squared error! We can check for these trends with the diff() function in R. all(diff(bias ^ 2) &lt; 0) ## [1] TRUE all(diff(variance) &gt; 0) ## [1] TRUE diff(mse) &lt; 0 ## 1 2 9 ## TRUE TRUE FALSE The models with polynomial degrees 2 and 9 are both essentially unbiased. We see some bias here as a result of using simulation. If we increased the number of simulations, we would see both biases go down. Since they are both unbiased, the model with degree 2 outperforms the model with degree 9 due to its smaller variance. Models with degree 0 and 1 are biased because they assume the wrong form of the regression function. While the degree 9 model does this as well, it does include all the necessary polynomial degrees. \\[ \\hat{f}_9(x) = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x + \\hat{\\beta}_2 x^2 + \\ldots + \\hat{\\beta}_9 x^9 \\] Then, since least squares estimation is unbiased, importantly, \\[ \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{\\beta}_d] = \\beta_d = 0 \\] for \\(d = 3, 4, \\ldots 9\\), we have \\[ \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\hat{f}_9(x)\\right] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 \\] Now we can finally verify the bias-variance decomposition. bias ^ 2 + variance == mse ## 0 1 2 9 ## FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE But wait, this says it isn’t true, except for the degree 9 model? It turns out, this is simply a computational issue. If we allow for some very small error tolerance, we see that the bias-variance decomposition is indeed true for predictions from these for models. all.equal(bias ^ 2 + variance, mse) ## [1] TRUE See ?all.equal() for details. So far, we’ve focused our efforts on looking at the mean squared error of estimating \\(f(0.90)\\) using \\(\\hat{f}(0.90)\\). We could also look at the expected prediction error of using \\(\\hat{f}(X)\\) when \\(X = 0.90\\) to estimate \\(Y\\). \\[ \\text{EPE}\\left(Y, \\hat{f}_k(0.90)\\right) = \\mathbb{E}_{Y \\mid X, \\mathcal{D}} \\left[ \\left(Y - \\hat{f}_k(X) \\right)^2 \\mid X = 0.90 \\right] \\] We can estimate this quantity for each of the four models using the simulation study we already performed. get_epe = function(realized, estimate) { mean((realized - estimate) ^ 2) } y = rnorm(n = nrow(predictions), mean = f(x = 0.9), sd = 0.3) epe = apply(predictions, 2, get_epe, realized = y) epe ## 0 1 2 9 ## 0.3180470 0.1104055 0.1095955 0.1205570 What about the unconditional expected prediction error. That is, for any \\(X\\), not just \\(0.90\\). Specifically, the expected prediction error of estimating \\(Y\\) using \\(\\hat{f}(X)\\). The following (new) simulation study provides an estimate of \\[ \\text{EPE}\\left(Y, \\hat{f}_k(X)\\right) = \\mathbb{E}_{X, Y, \\mathcal{D}} \\left[ \\left( Y - \\hat{f}_k(X) \\right)^2 \\right] \\] for the quadratic model, that is \\(k = 2\\) as we have defined \\(k\\). set.seed(1) n_sims = 1000 X = runif(n = n_sims, min = 0, max = 1) Y = rnorm(n = n_sims, mean = f(X), sd = 0.3) f_hat_X = rep(0, length(X)) for (i in seq_along(X)) { sim_data = get_sim_data(f) fit_2 = lm(y ~ poly(x, degree = 2), data = sim_data) f_hat_X[i] = predict(fit_2, newdata = data.frame(x = X[i])) } mean((Y - f_hat_X) ^ 2) ## [1] 0.09997319 Note that in practice, we should use many more simulations in this study. 8.4 Estimating Expected Prediction Error While previously, we only decomposed the expected prediction error conditionally, a similar argument holds unconditionally. Assuming \\[ \\mathbb{V}[Y \\mid X = x] = \\sigma ^ 2. \\] we have \\[ \\text{EPE}\\left(Y, \\hat{f}(X)\\right) = \\mathbb{E}_{X, Y, \\mathcal{D}} \\left[ (Y - \\hat{f}(X))^2 \\right] = \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}_{X} \\left[\\text{bias}^2\\left(\\hat{f}(X)\\right)\\right] + \\mathbb{E}_{X} \\left[\\text{var}\\left(\\hat{f}(X)\\right)\\right]}_\\textrm{reducible error} + \\sigma^2 \\] Lastly, we note that if \\[ \\mathcal{D} = \\mathcal{D}_{\\texttt{trn}} \\cup \\mathcal{D}_{\\texttt{tst}} = (x_i, y_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^p \\times \\mathbb{R}, \\ i = 1, 2, \\ldots n \\] where \\[ \\mathcal{D}_{\\texttt{trn}} = (x_i, y_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^p \\times \\mathbb{R}, \\ i \\in \\texttt{trn} \\] and \\[ \\mathcal{D}_{\\texttt{tst}} = (x_i, y_i) \\in \\mathbb{R}^p \\times \\mathbb{R}, \\ i \\in \\texttt{tst} \\] Then, if we use \\(\\mathcal{D}_{\\texttt{trn}}\\) to fit (train) a model, we can use the test mean squared error \\[ \\sum_{i \\in \\texttt{tst}}\\left(y_i - \\hat{f}(x_i)\\right) ^ 2 \\] as an estimate of \\[ \\mathbb{E}_{X, Y, \\mathcal{D}} \\left[ (Y - \\hat{f}(X))^2 \\right] \\] the expected prediction error. (In practice we prefer RMSE to MSE for comparing models because of the units.) How good is this estimate? Well, if \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) is a random sample from \\((X, Y)\\), and \\(\\texttt{tst}\\) is randomly sampled from \\(i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\), then it is an unbiased estimate. However, it is variable. How variable? It turns out, pretty variable. It’s unbiasedness justifies it as an estimate for now, but we’ll fix the variability issue later. 8.5 rmarkdown The rmarkdown file for this chapter can be found here.

Our goal is to find a rule, algorithm, or function which takes as input a feature vector, and outputs a category which is the true category as often as possible. That is, the classifier \\(\\hat{C}(x)\\) returns the predicted category \\(\\hat{y}(X)\\). \\[ \\hat{y}(x) = \\hat{C}(x) \\] To build our first classifier, we will use the Default dataset from the ISLR package. library(ISLR) library(tibble) as_tibble(Default) ## # A tibble: 10,000 x 4 ## default student balance income ## &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;fctr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 No No 729.5265 44361.625 ## 2 No Yes 817.1804 12106.135 ## 3 No No 1073.5492 31767.139 ## 4 No No 529.2506 35704.494 ## 5 No No 785.6559 38463.496 ## 6 No Yes 919.5885 7491.559 ## 7 No No 825.5133 24905.227 ## 8 No Yes 808.6675 17600.451 ## 9 No No 1161.0579 37468.529 ## 10 No No 0.0000 29275.268 ## # ... with 9,990 more rows Our goal is to properly classify individuals as defaulters based on student status, credit card balance, and income.

In this case, using 50% for each. set.seed(42) default_idx = sample(nrow(Default), 5000) default_trn = Default[default_idx, ] default_tst = Default[-default_idx, ] 9.1 Visualization for Classification Often, some simple visualizations can suggest simple classification rules. To quickly create some useful visualizations, we use the featurePlot() function from the caret() package. library(caret) A density plot can often suggest a simple split based on a numeric predictor. Essentially this plot graphs a density estimate \\[ \\hat{f}_{X_i}(x_i \\mid Y = k) \\] for each numeric predictor \\(x_i\\) and each category \\(k\\) of the response \\(y\\). featurePlot(x = default_trn[, c(&quot;balance&quot;, &quot;income&quot;)], y = default_trn$default, plot = &quot;density&quot;, scales = list(x = list(relation = &quot;free&quot;), y = list(relation = &quot;free&quot;)), adjust = 1.5, pch = &quot;|&quot;, layout = c(2, 1), auto.key = list(columns = 2)) Some notes about the arguments to this function: x is a data frame containing only numeric predictors. It would be nonsensical to estimate a density for a categorical predictor. y is the response variable. It needs to be a factor variable. If coded as 0 and 1, you will need to coerce to factor for plotting. plot specifies the type of plot, here density. scales defines the scale of the axes for each plot. By default, the axis of each plot would be the same, which often is not useful, so the arguments here, a different axis for each plot, will almost always be used. adjust specifies the amount of smoothing used for the density estimate. pch specifies the plot character used for the bottom of the plot. layout places the individual plots into rows and columns. For some odd reason, it is given as (col, row). auto.key defines the key at the top of the plot. The number of columns should be the number of categories. It seems that the income variable by itself is not particularly useful. However, there seems to be a big difference in default status at a balance of about 1400. We will use this information shortly. featurePlot(x = default_trn[, c(&quot;balance&quot;, &quot;income&quot;)], y = default_trn$student, plot = &quot;density&quot;, scales = list(x = list(relation = &quot;free&quot;), y = list(relation = &quot;free&quot;)), adjust = 1.5, pch = &quot;|&quot;, layout = c(2, 1), auto.key = list(columns = 2)) Above, we create a similar plot, except with student as the response. We see that students often carry a slightly larger balance, and have far lower income. This will be useful to know when making more complicated classifiers. featurePlot(x = default_trn[, c(&quot;student&quot;, &quot;balance&quot;, &quot;income&quot;)], y = default_trn$default, plot = &quot;pairs&quot;, auto.key = list(columns = 2)) We can use plot = &quot;pairs&quot; to consider multiple variables at the same time. This plot reinforces using balance to create a classifier, and again shows that income seems not that useful. library(ellipse) featurePlot(x = default_trn[, c(&quot;balance&quot;, &quot;income&quot;)], y = default_trn$default, plot = &quot;ellipse&quot;, auto.key = list(columns = 2)) Similar to pairs is a plot of type ellipse, which requires the ellipse package. Here we only use numeric predictors, as essentially we are assuming multivariate normality. The ellipses mark points of equal density. This will be useful later when discussing LDA and QDA. 9.2 A Simple Classifier A very simple classifier is a rule based on a boundary \\(b\\) for a particular input variable \\(x\\). \\[ \\hat{C}(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; x &gt; b \\\\ 0 &amp; x \\leq b \\end{cases} \\] Based on the first plot, we believe we can use balance to create a reasonable classifier. In particular, \\[ \\hat{C}(\\texttt{balance}) = \\begin{cases} \\text{Yes} &amp; \\texttt{balance} &gt; 1400 \\\\ \\text{No} &amp; \\texttt{balance} \\leq 1400 \\end{cases} \\] So we predict an individual is a defaulter if their balance is above 1400, and not a defaulter if the balance is 1400 or less. simple_class = function(x, boundary, above = 1, below = 0) { ifelse(x &gt; boundary, above, below) } We write a simple R function that compares a variable to a boundary, then use it to make predictions on the train and test sets with our chosen variable and boundary. default_trn_pred = simple_class(x = default_trn$balance, boundary = 1400, above = &quot;Yes&quot;, below = &quot;No&quot;) default_tst_pred = simple_class(x = default_tst$balance, boundary = 1400, above = &quot;Yes&quot;, below = &quot;No&quot;) head(default_tst_pred, n = 10) ## [1] &quot;No&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;No&quot; 9.3 Metrics for Classification In the classification setting, there are a large number of metrics to assess how well a classifier is performing. One of the most obvious things to do is arrange predictions and true values in a cross table. (trn_tab = table(predicted = default_trn_pred, actual = default_trn$default)) ## actual ## predicted No Yes ## No 4319 29 ## Yes 513 139 (tst_tab = table(predicted = default_tst_pred, actual = default_tst$default)) ## actual ## predicted No Yes ## No 4361 23 ## Yes 474 142 Often we give specific names to individual cells of these tables, and in the predictive setting, we would call this table a confusion matrix. Be aware, that the placement of Actual and Predicted values affects the names of the cells, and often the matrix may be presented transposed. In statistics, we label the errors Type I and Type II, but these are hard to remember. False Positive and False Negative are more descriptive, so we choose to use these. The confusionMatrix() function from the caret package can be used to obtain a wealth of additional information, which we see output below for the test data. Note that we specify which category is considered “positive.” trn_con_mat = confusionMatrix(trn_tab, positive = &quot;Yes&quot;) (tst_con_mat = confusionMatrix(tst_tab, positive = &quot;Yes&quot;)) ## Confusion Matrix and Statistics ## ## actual ## predicted No Yes ## No 4361 23 ## Yes 474 142 ## ## Accuracy : 0.9006 ## 95% CI : (0.892, 0.9088) ## No Information Rate : 0.967 ## P-Value [Acc &gt; NIR] : 1 ## ## Kappa : 0.3287 ## Mcnemar&#39;s Test P-Value : &lt;2e-16 ## ## Sensitivity : 0.8606 ## Specificity : 0.9020 ## Pos Pred Value : 0.2305 ## Neg Pred Value : 0.9948 ## Prevalence : 0.0330 ## Detection Rate : 0.0284 ## Detection Prevalence : 0.1232 ## Balanced Accuracy : 0.8813 ## ## &#39;Positive&#39; Class : Yes ## The most common, and most important metric is the classification error rate. \\[ \\text{err}(\\hat{C}, \\text{Data}) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}I(y_i \\neq \\hat{C}(x_i)) \\] Here, \\(I\\) is an indicator function, so we are essentially calculating the proportion of predicted classes that match the true class. \\[ I(y_i \\neq \\hat{C}(x)) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; y_i \\neq \\hat{C}(x) \\\\ 0 &amp; y_i = \\hat{C}(x) \\\\ \\end{cases} \\] It is also common to discuss the accuracy, which is simply one minus the error. Like regression, we often split the data, and then consider Train (Classification) Error and Test (Classification) Error will be used as a measure of how well a classifier will work on unseen future data. \\[ \\text{err}_{\\texttt{trn}}(\\hat{C}, \\text{Train Data}) = \\frac{1}{n_{\\texttt{trn}}}\\sum_{i \\in \\texttt{trn}}^{}I(y_i \\neq \\hat{C}(x_i)) \\] \\[ \\text{err}_{\\texttt{tst}}(\\hat{C}, \\text{Test Data}) = \\frac{1}{n_{\\texttt{tst}}}\\sum_{i \\in \\texttt{tst}}^{}I(y_i \\neq \\hat{C}(x_i)) \\] Accuracy values can be found by calling confusionMatrix(), or, if stored, can be accessed directly. Here, we use them to obtain error rates. 1 - trn_con_mat$overall[&quot;Accuracy&quot;] ## Accuracy ## 0.1084 1 - tst_con_mat$overall[&quot;Accuracy&quot;] ## Accuracy ## 0.0994 Sometimes guarding against making certain errors, FP or FN, are more important than simply finding the best accuracy. Thus, sometimes we will consider sensitivity and specificity. \\[ \\text{Sens} = \\text{True Positive Rate} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{P}} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP + FN}} \\] tst_con_mat$byClass[&quot;Sensitivity&quot;] ## Sensitivity ## 0.8606061 \\[ \\text{Spec} = \\text{True Negative Rate} = \\frac{\\text{TN}}{\\text{N}} = \\frac{\\text{TN}}{\\text{TN + FP}} \\] tst_con_mat$byClass[&quot;Specificity&quot;] ## Specificity ## 0.9019648 Like accuracy, these can easily be found using confusionMatrix(). When considering how well a classifier is performing, often, it is understandable to assume that any accuracy in a binary classification problem above 0.50, is a reasonable classifier. This however is not the case. We need to consider the balance of the classes. To do so, we look at the prevalence of positive cases. \\[ \\text{Prev} = \\frac{\\text{P}}{\\text{Total Obs}}= \\frac{\\text{TP + FN}}{\\text{Total Obs}} \\] trn_con_mat$byClass[&quot;Prevalence&quot;] ## Prevalence ## 0.0336 tst_con_mat$byClass[&quot;Prevalence&quot;] ## Prevalence ## 0.033 Here, we see an extremely low prevalence, which suggests an even simpler classifier than our current based on balance. \\[ \\hat{C}(\\texttt{balance}) = \\begin{cases} \\text{No} &amp; \\texttt{balance} &gt; 1400 \\\\ \\text{No} &amp; \\texttt{balance} \\leq 1400 \\end{cases} \\] This classifier simply classifies all observations as negative cases. pred_all_no = simple_class(default_tst$balance, boundary = 1400, above = &quot;No&quot;, below = &quot;No&quot;) table(predicted = pred_all_no, actual = default_tst$default) ## actual ## predicted No Yes ## No 4835 165 The confusionMatrix() function won’t even accept this table as input, because it isn’t a full matrix, only one row, so we calculate error rates directly. To do so, we write a function. calc_class_err = function(actual, predicted) { mean(actual != predicted) } calc_class_err(actual = default_tst$default, predicted = pred_all_no) ## [1] 0.033 Here we see that the error rate is exactly the prevelance of the minority class. table(default_tst$default) / length(default_tst$default) ## ## No Yes ## 0.967 0.033 This classifier does better than the previous. But the point is, in reality, to create a good classifier, we should obtain a test error better than 0.033, which is obtained by simply manipulating the prevalences. Next chapter, we’ll introduce much better classifiers which should have no problem accomplishing this task. 9.4 rmarkdown The rmarkdown file for this chapter can be found here.

Recall that, \\[ \\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[Y \\mid X = x] = X\\hat{\\beta}. \\] Since \\(Y\\) is limited to values of \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), we have \\[ \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X = x] = P(Y = 1 \\mid X = x). \\] It would then seem reasonable that \\(\\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\beta}\\) is a reasonable estimate of \\(P(Y = 1 \\mid X = x)\\). We test this on the Default data. model_lm = lm(default ~ balance, data = default_trn_lm) Everything seems to be working, until we plot the results. plot(default ~ balance, data = default_trn_lm, col = &quot;darkorange&quot;, pch = &quot;|&quot;, ylim = c(-0.2, 1), main = &quot;Using Linear Regression for Classification&quot;) abline(h = 0, lty = 3) abline(h = 1, lty = 3) abline(h = 0.5, lty = 2) abline(model_lm, lwd = 3, col = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;) Two issues arise. First, all of the predicted probabilities are below 0.5. That means, we would classify every observation as a &quot;No&quot;. This is certainly possible, but not what we would expect. all(predict(model_lm) &lt; 0.5) ## [1] TRUE The next, and bigger issue, is predicted probabilities less than 0. any(predict(model_lm) &lt; 0) ## [1] TRUE 10.2 Bayes Classifier Why are we using a predicted probability of 0.5 as the cutoff for classification? Recall, the Bayes Classifier, which minimizes the classification error: \\[ C^B(x) = \\underset{g}{\\mathrm{argmax}} \\ P(Y = g \\mid X = x) \\] So, in the binary classification problem, we will use predicted probabilities \\[ \\hat{p}(x) = \\hat{P}(Y = 1 \\mid { X = x}) \\] and \\[ \\hat{P}(Y = 0 \\mid { X = x}) \\] and then classify to the larger of the two. We actually only need to consider a single probability, usually \\(\\hat{P}(Y = 1 \\mid { X = x})\\). Since we use it so often, we give it the shorthand notation, \\(\\hat{p}(x)\\). Then the classifier is written, \\[ \\hat{C}(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\hat{p}(x) &gt; 0.5 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\hat{p}(x) \\leq 0.5 \\end{cases} \\] This classifier is essentially estimating the Bayes Classifier, thus, is seeking to minimize classification errors. 10.3 Logistic Regression with glm() To better estimate the probability \\[ p(x) = P(Y = 1 \\mid {X = x}) \\] we turn to logistic regression. The model is written \\[ \\log\\left(\\frac{p(x)}{1 - p(x)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_p. \\] Rearranging, we see the probabilities can be written as \\[ p(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_p)}} = \\sigma(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_p) \\] Notice, we use the sigmoid function as shorthand notation, which appears often in deep learning literature. It takes any real input, and outputs a number between 0 and 1. How useful! (This is actualy a particular sigmoid function called the logistic function, but since it is by far the most popular sigmoid function, often sigmoid function is used to refer to the logistic function) \\[ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{e^x}{1 + e^x} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} \\] The model is fit by numerically maximizing the likelihood, which we will let R take care of. We start with a single predictor example, again using balance as our single predictor. model_glm = glm(default ~ balance, data = default_trn, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) Fitting this model looks very similar to fitting a simple linear regression. Instead of lm() we use glm(). The only other difference is the use of family = &quot;binomial&quot; which indicates that we have a two-class categorical response. Using glm() with family = &quot;gaussian&quot; would perform the usual linear regression. First, we can obtain the fitted coefficients the same way we did with linear regression. coef(model_glm) ## (Intercept) balance ## -10.452182876 0.005367655 The next thing we should understand is how the predict() function works with glm(). So, let’s look at some predictions. head(predict(model_glm)) ## 9149 9370 2861 8302 6415 5189 ## -6.9616496 -0.7089539 -4.8936916 -9.4123620 -9.0416096 -7.3600645 By default, predict.glm() uses type = &quot;link&quot;. head(predict(model_glm, type = &quot;link&quot;)) ## 9149 9370 2861 8302 6415 5189 ## -6.9616496 -0.7089539 -4.8936916 -9.4123620 -9.0416096 -7.3600645 That is, R is returning \\[ \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_1 + \\hat{\\beta}_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\hat{\\beta}_p x_p \\] for each observation. Importantly, these are not predicted probabilities. To obtain the predicted probabilities \\[ \\hat{p}(x) = \\hat{P}(Y = 1 \\mid X = x) \\] we need to use type = &quot;response&quot; head(predict(model_glm, type = &quot;response&quot;)) ## 9149 9370 2861 8302 6415 ## 9.466353e-04 3.298300e-01 7.437969e-03 8.170105e-05 1.183661e-04 ## 5189 ## 6.357530e-04 Note that these are probabilities, not classifications. To obtain classifications, we will need to compare to the correct cutoff value with an ifelse() statement. model_glm_pred = ifelse(predict(model_glm, type = &quot;link&quot;) &gt; 0, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;) # model_glm_pred = ifelse(predict(model_glm, type = &quot;response&quot;) &gt; 0.5, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;) The line that is run is performing \\[ \\hat{C}(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\hat{f}(x) &gt; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\hat{f}(x) \\leq 0 \\end{cases} \\] where \\[ \\hat{f}(x) =\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_1 + \\hat{\\beta}_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\hat{\\beta}_p x_p. \\] The commented line, which would give the same results, is performing \\[ \\hat{C}(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\hat{p}(x) &gt; 0.5 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\hat{p}(x) \\leq 0.5 \\end{cases} \\] where \\[ \\hat{p}(x) = \\hat{P}(Y = 1 \\mid X = x). \\] Once we have classifications, we can calculate metrics such as the trainging classification error rate. calc_class_err = function(actual, predicted) { mean(actual != predicted) } calc_class_err(actual = default_trn$default, predicted = model_glm_pred) ## [1] 0.0278 As we saw previously, the table() and confusionMatrix() functions can be used to quickly obtain many more metrics. train_tab = table(predicted = model_glm_pred, actual = default_trn$default) library(caret) train_con_mat = confusionMatrix(train_tab, positive = &quot;Yes&quot;) c(train_con_mat$overall[&quot;Accuracy&quot;], train_con_mat$byClass[&quot;Sensitivity&quot;], train_con_mat$byClass[&quot;Specificity&quot;]) ## Accuracy Sensitivity Specificity ## 0.9722000 0.2738095 0.9964818 We could also write a custom function for the error for use with trained logist regression models. get_logistic_error = function(mod, data, res = &quot;y&quot;, pos = 1, neg = 0, cut = 0.5) { probs = predict(mod, newdata = data, type = &quot;response&quot;) preds = ifelse(probs &gt; cut, pos, neg) calc_class_err(actual = data[, res], predicted = preds) } This function will be useful later when calculating train and test errors for several models at the same time. get_logistic_error(model_glm, data = default_trn, res = &quot;default&quot;, pos = &quot;Yes&quot;, neg = &quot;No&quot;, cut = 0.5) ## [1] 0.0278 To see how much better logistic regression is for this task, we create the same plot we used for linear regression. plot(default ~ balance, data = default_trn_lm, col = &quot;darkorange&quot;, pch = &quot;|&quot;, ylim = c(-0.2, 1), main = &quot;Using Logistic Regression for Classification&quot;) abline(h = 0, lty = 3) abline(h = 1, lty = 3) abline(h = 0.5, lty = 2) curve(predict(model_glm, data.frame(balance = x), type = &quot;response&quot;), add = TRUE, lwd = 3, col = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;) abline(v = -coef(model_glm)[1] / coef(model_glm)[2], lwd = 2) This plot contains a wealth of information. The orange | characters are the data, \\((x_i, y_i)\\). The blue “curve” is the predicted probabilities given by the fitted logistic regression. That is, \\[ \\hat{p}(x) = \\hat{P}(Y = 1 \\mid { X = x}) \\] The solid vertical black line represents the decision boundary, the balance that obtains a predicted probability of 0.5. In this case balance = 1947.252994. The decision boundary is found by solving for points that satisfy \\[ \\hat{p}(x) = \\hat{P}(Y = 1 \\mid { X = x}) = 0.5 \\] This is equivalent to point that satisfy \\[ \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_1 = 0. \\] Thus, for logistic regression with a single predictor, the decision boundary is given by the point \\[ x_1 = \\frac{-\\hat{\\beta}_0}{\\hat{\\beta}_1}. \\] The following is not run, but an alternative way to add the logistic curve to the plot. grid = seq(0, max(default_trn$balance), by = 0.01) sigmoid = function(x) { 1 / (1 + exp(-x)) } lines(grid, sigmoid(coef(model_glm)[1] + coef(model_glm)[2] * grid), lwd = 3) Using the usual formula syntax, it is easy to add or remove complexity from logistic regressions. model_1 = glm(default ~ 1, data = default_trn, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) model_2 = glm(default ~ ., data = default_trn, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) model_3 = glm(default ~ . ^ 2 + I(balance ^ 2), data = default_trn, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) Note that, using polynomial transformations of predictors will allow a linear model to have non-linear decision boundaries. model_list = list(model_1, model_2, model_3) train_errors = sapply(model_list, get_logistic_error, data = default_trn, res = &quot;default&quot;, pos = &quot;Yes&quot;, neg = &quot;No&quot;, cut = 0.5) test_errors = sapply(model_list, get_logistic_error, data = default_tst, res = &quot;default&quot;, pos = &quot;Yes&quot;, neg = &quot;No&quot;, cut = 0.5) Here we see the misclassification error rates for each model. The train decreases, and the test decreases, until it starts to increases. Everything we learned about the bias-variance tradeoff for regression also applies here. diff(train_errors) ## [1] -0.0058 -0.0002 diff(test_errors) ## [1] -0.0068 0.0004 We call model_2 the additive logistic model, which we will use quite often. 10.4 ROC Curves Let’s return to our simple model with only balance as a predictor. model_glm = glm(default ~ balance, data = default_trn, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) We write a function which allows use to make predictions based on different probability cutoffs. get_logistic_pred = function(mod, data, res = &quot;y&quot;, pos = 1, neg = 0, cut = 0.5) { probs = predict(mod, newdata = data, type = &quot;response&quot;) ifelse(probs &gt; cut, pos, neg) } \\[ \\hat{C}(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\hat{p}(x) &gt; c \\\\ 0 &amp; \\hat{p}(x) \\leq c \\end{cases} \\] Let’s use this to obtain predictions using a low, medium, and high cutoff. (0.1, 0.5, and 0.9) test_pred_10 = get_logistic_pred(model_glm, data = default_tst, res = &quot;default&quot;, pos = &quot;Yes&quot;, neg = &quot;No&quot;, cut = 0.1) test_pred_50 = get_logistic_pred(model_glm, data = default_tst, res = &quot;default&quot;, pos = &quot;Yes&quot;, neg = &quot;No&quot;, cut = 0.5) test_pred_90 = get_logistic_pred(model_glm, data = default_tst, res = &quot;default&quot;, pos = &quot;Yes&quot;, neg = &quot;No&quot;, cut = 0.9) Now we evaluate accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for these classifiers. test_tab_10 = table(predicted = test_pred_10, actual = default_tst$default) test_tab_50 = table(predicted = test_pred_50, actual = default_tst$default) test_tab_90 = table(predicted = test_pred_90, actual = default_tst$default) test_con_mat_10 = confusionMatrix(test_tab_10, positive = &quot;Yes&quot;) test_con_mat_50 = confusionMatrix(test_tab_50, positive = &quot;Yes&quot;) test_con_mat_90 = confusionMatrix(test_tab_90, positive = &quot;Yes&quot;) metrics = rbind( c(test_con_mat_10$overall[&quot;Accuracy&quot;], test_con_mat_10$byClass[&quot;Sensitivity&quot;], test_con_mat_10$byClass[&quot;Specificity&quot;]), c(test_con_mat_50$overall[&quot;Accuracy&quot;], test_con_mat_50$byClass[&quot;Sensitivity&quot;], test_con_mat_50$byClass[&quot;Specificity&quot;]), c(test_con_mat_90$overall[&quot;Accuracy&quot;], test_con_mat_90$byClass[&quot;Sensitivity&quot;], test_con_mat_90$byClass[&quot;Specificity&quot;]) ) rownames(metrics) = c(&quot;c = 0.10&quot;, &quot;c = 0.50&quot;, &quot;c = 0.90&quot;) metrics ## Accuracy Sensitivity Specificity ## c = 0.10 0.9404 0.77575758 0.9460186 ## c = 0.50 0.9738 0.31515152 0.9962771 ## c = 0.90 0.9674 0.01818182 0.9997932 We see then sensitivity decreases as the cutoff is increased. Conversely, specificity increases as the cutoff increases. This is useful if we are more interested in a particular error, instead of giving them equal weight. Note that usually the best accuracy will be seen near \\(c = 0.50\\). Instead of manually checking cutoffs, we can create an ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve) which will sweep through all possible cutoffs, and plot the sensitivity and specificity. library(pROC) test_prob = predict(model_glm, newdata = default_tst, type = &quot;response&quot;) test_roc = roc(default_tst$default ~ test_prob, plot = TRUE, print.auc = TRUE) as.numeric(test_roc$auc) ## [1] 0.9515076 A good model will have a high AUC, that is as often as possible a high sensitivity and specificity. 10.5 Multinomial Logistic Regression What if the response contains more than two categories? For that we need multinomial logistic regression. \\[ P(Y = k \\mid { X = x}) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_{0k} + \\beta_{1k} x_1 + \\cdots + + \\beta_{pk} x_p}}{\\sum_{g = 1}^{G} e^{\\beta_{0g} + \\beta_{1g} x_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_{pg} x_p}} \\] We will omit the details, as ISL has as well. If you are interested, the Wikipedia page provides a rather thorough coverage. Also note that the above is an example of the softmax function. As an example of a dataset with a three category response, we use the iris dataset, which is so famous, it has its own Wikipedia entry. It is also a default dataset in R, so no need to load it. Before proceeding, we test-train split this data. set.seed(430) iris_obs = nrow(iris) iris_idx = sample(iris_obs, size = trunc(0.50 * iris_obs)) iris_trn = iris[iris_idx, ] iris_test = iris[-iris_idx, ] To perform multinomial logistic regression, we use the multinom function from the nnet package. Training using multinom() is done using similar syntax to lm() and glm(). We add the trace = FALSE argument to suppress information about updates to the optimization routine as the model is trained. library(nnet) model_multi = multinom(Species ~ ., data = iris_trn, trace = FALSE) summary(model_multi)$coefficients ## (Intercept) Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## versicolor 26.81602 -6.983313 -16.24574 20.35750 3.218787 ## virginica -34.24228 -8.398869 -17.03985 31.94659 11.594518 Notice we are only given coefficients for two of the three class, much like only needing coefficients for one class in logistic regression. A difference between glm() and multinom() is how the predict() function operates. head(predict(model_multi, newdata = iris_trn)) ## [1] setosa virginica setosa setosa virginica setosa ## Levels: setosa versicolor virginica head(predict(model_multi, newdata = iris_trn, type = &quot;prob&quot;)) ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 23 1.000000e+00 2.607782e-19 3.891079e-44 ## 106 4.461651e-38 2.328295e-09 1.000000e+00 ## 37 1.000000e+00 1.108222e-18 1.620112e-42 ## 40 1.000000e+00 5.389221e-15 1.525649e-37 ## 145 1.146554e-28 9.816687e-07 9.999990e-01 ## 36 1.000000e+00 6.216549e-16 7.345269e-40 Notice that by default, classifications are returned. When obtaining probabilities, we are given the predicted probability for each class. Interestingly, you’ve just fit a neural network, and you didn’t even know it! (Hence the nnet package.) Later we will discuss the connections between logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, and simple neural networks. 10.6 rmarkdown The rmarkdown file for this chapter can be found here.

We introduce three new methods, each a generative method. This in comparison to logistic regression, which is a discriminative method. Generative methods model the joint probability, \\(p(x, y)\\), often by assuming some distribution for the conditional distribution of \\(X\\) given \\(Y\\), \\(f(x \\mid y)\\). Bayes theorem is then applied to classify according to \\(p(y \\mid x)\\). Discriminative methods directly model this conditional, \\(p(y \\mid x)\\). A detailed discussion and analysis can be found in Ng and Jordan, 2002. Each of the methods in this chapter will use Bayes theorem to build a classifier. \\[ p_k(x) = P(Y = k \\mid X = x) = \\frac{\\pi_k \\cdot f_k(x)}{\\sum_{g = 1}^{G} \\pi_g \\cdot f_g(x)} \\] We call \\(p_k(x)\\) the posterior probability, which we will estimate then use to create classifications. The \\(\\pi_g\\) are called the prior probabilities for each possible class \\(g\\). That is, \\(\\pi_g = P(Y = g)\\), unconditioned on \\(X\\). The \\(f_g(x)\\) are called the likelihoods, which are indexed by \\(g\\) to denote that they are conditional on the classes. The denominator is often referred to as a normalizing constant. The methods will differ by placing different modeling assumptions on the likelihoods, \\(f_g(x)\\). For each method, the priors could be learned from data or pre-specified. For each method, classifications are made to the class with the highest estimated posterior probability, which is equivalent to the class with the largest \\[ \\log(\\hat{\\pi}_k \\cdot \\hat{f}_k({\\mathbf x})). \\] By substituting the corresponding likelihoods, simplifying, and eliminating unnecessary terms, we could derive the discriminant function for each. To illustrate these new methods, we return to the iris data, which you may remember has three classes. After a test-train split, we create a number of plots to refresh our memory. set.seed(430) iris_obs = nrow(iris) iris_idx = sample(iris_obs, size = trunc(0.50 * iris_obs)) # iris_index = sample(iris_obs, size = trunc(0.10 * iris_obs)) iris_trn = iris[iris_idx, ] iris_tst = iris[-iris_idx, ] caret::featurePlot(x = iris_trn[, c(&quot;Sepal.Length&quot;, &quot;Sepal.Width&quot;, &quot;Petal.Length&quot;, &quot;Petal.Width&quot;)], y = iris_trn$Species, plot = &quot;density&quot;, scales = list(x = list(relation = &quot;free&quot;), y = list(relation = &quot;free&quot;)), adjust = 1.5, pch = &quot;|&quot;, layout = c(2, 2), auto.key = list(columns = 3)) caret::featurePlot(x = iris_trn[, c(&quot;Sepal.Length&quot;, &quot;Sepal.Width&quot;, &quot;Petal.Length&quot;, &quot;Petal.Width&quot;)], y = iris_trn$Species, plot = &quot;ellipse&quot;, auto.key = list(columns = 3)) caret::featurePlot(x = iris_trn[, c(&quot;Sepal.Length&quot;, &quot;Sepal.Width&quot;, &quot;Petal.Length&quot;, &quot;Petal.Width&quot;)], y = iris_trn$Species, plot = &quot;box&quot;, scales = list(y = list(relation = &quot;free&quot;), x = list(rot = 90)), layout = c(4, 1)) Especially based on the pairs plot, we see that it should not be too difficult to find a good classifier. Notice that we use caret::featurePlot to access the featurePlot() function without loading the entire caret package. 11.1 Linear Discriminant Analysis LDA assumes that the predictors are multivariate normal conditioned on the classes. \\[ X \\mid Y = k \\sim N(\\mu_k, \\Sigma) \\] \\[ f_k({\\mathbf x}) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{p/2}|\\Sigma|^{1/2}}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf x - \\mu_k)^{\\prime}\\Sigma^{-1}(\\mathbf x - \\mu_k)\\right] \\] Notice that \\(\\Sigma\\) does not depend on \\(k\\), that is, we are assuming the same \\(\\Sigma\\) for each class. We then use information from all the classes to estimate \\(\\Sigma\\). To fit an LDA model, we use the lda() function from the MASS package. library(MASS) iris_lda = lda(Species ~ ., data = iris_trn) iris_lda ## Call: ## lda(Species ~ ., data = iris_trn) ## ## Prior probabilities of groups: ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 0.3733333 0.3200000 0.3066667 ## ## Group means: ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## setosa 4.978571 3.378571 1.432143 0.2607143 ## versicolor 5.995833 2.808333 4.254167 1.3333333 ## virginica 6.669565 3.065217 5.717391 2.0956522 ## ## Coefficients of linear discriminants: ## LD1 LD2 ## Sepal.Length 0.7100013 -0.8446128 ## Sepal.Width 1.2435532 2.4773120 ## Petal.Length -2.3419418 -0.4065865 ## Petal.Width -1.8502355 2.3234441 ## ## Proportion of trace: ## LD1 LD2 ## 0.9908 0.0092 Here we see the estimated \\(\\hat{\\pi}_k\\) and \\(\\hat{\\mu}_k\\) for each class. is.list(predict(iris_lda, iris_trn)) ## [1] TRUE names(predict(iris_lda, iris_trn)) ## [1] &quot;class&quot; &quot;posterior&quot; &quot;x&quot; head(predict(iris_lda, iris_trn)$class, n = 10) ## [1] setosa virginica setosa setosa virginica setosa ## [7] virginica setosa versicolor setosa ## Levels: setosa versicolor virginica head(predict(iris_lda, iris_trn)$posterior, n = 10) ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 23 1.000000e+00 1.517145e-21 1.717663e-41 ## 106 2.894733e-43 1.643603e-06 9.999984e-01 ## 37 1.000000e+00 2.169066e-20 1.287216e-40 ## 40 1.000000e+00 3.979954e-17 8.243133e-36 ## 145 1.303566e-37 4.335258e-06 9.999957e-01 ## 36 1.000000e+00 1.947567e-18 5.996917e-38 ## 119 2.220147e-51 9.587514e-09 1.000000e+00 ## 16 1.000000e+00 5.981936e-23 1.344538e-42 ## 94 1.599359e-11 9.999999e-01 1.035129e-07 ## 27 1.000000e+00 8.154612e-15 4.862249e-32 As we should come to expect, the predict() function operates in a new way when called on an lda object.

The only error is labeling a virginica as a versicolor. iris_lda_flat = lda(Species ~ ., data = iris_trn, prior = c(1, 1, 1) / 3) iris_lda_flat ## Call: ## lda(Species ~ ., data = iris_trn, prior = c(1, 1, 1)/3) ## ## Prior probabilities of groups: ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 0.3333333 0.3333333 0.3333333 ## ## Group means: ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## setosa 4.978571 3.378571 1.432143 0.2607143 ## versicolor 5.995833 2.808333 4.254167 1.3333333 ## virginica 6.669565 3.065217 5.717391 2.0956522 ## ## Coefficients of linear discriminants: ## LD1 LD2 ## Sepal.Length 0.7136357 -0.8415442 ## Sepal.Width 1.2328623 2.4826497 ## Petal.Length -2.3401674 -0.4166784 ## Petal.Width -1.8602343 2.3154465 ## ## Proportion of trace: ## LD1 LD2 ## 0.9901 0.0099 Instead of learning (estimating) the proportion of the three species from the data, we could instead specify them ourselves. Here we choose a uniform distributions over the possible species. We would call this a “flat” prior. iris_lda_flat_trn_pred = predict(iris_lda_flat, iris_trn)$class iris_lda_flat_tst_pred = predict(iris_lda_flat, iris_tst)$class calc_class_err(predicted = iris_lda_flat_trn_pred, actual = iris_trn$Species) ## [1] 0.04 calc_class_err(predicted = iris_lda_flat_tst_pred, actual = iris_tst$Species) ## [1] 0 This actually gives a better test accuracy! 11.2 Quadratic Discriminant Analysis QDA also assumes that the predictors are multivariate normal conditioned on the classes. \\[ X \\mid Y = k \\sim N(\\mu_k, \\Sigma_k) \\] \\[ f_k({\\mathbf x}) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{p/2}|\\Sigma_k|^{1/2}}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf x - \\mu_k)^{\\prime}\\Sigma_{k}^{-1}(\\mathbf x - \\mu_k)\\right] \\] Notice that now \\(\\Sigma_k\\) does depend on \\(k\\), that is, we are allowing a different \\(\\Sigma_k\\) for each class. We only use information from class \\(k\\) to estimate \\(\\Sigma_k\\). iris_qda = qda(Species ~ ., data = iris_trn) iris_qda ## Call: ## qda(Species ~ ., data = iris_trn) ## ## Prior probabilities of groups: ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 0.3733333 0.3200000 0.3066667 ## ## Group means: ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## setosa 4.978571 3.378571 1.432143 0.2607143 ## versicolor 5.995833 2.808333 4.254167 1.3333333 ## virginica 6.669565 3.065217 5.717391 2.0956522 Here the output is similar to LDA, again giving the estimated \\(\\hat{\\pi}_k\\) and \\(\\hat{\\mu}_k\\) for each class. Like lda(), the qda() function is found in the MASS package. Consider trying to fit QDA again, but this time with a smaller training set. (Use the commented line above to obtain a smaller test set.) This will cause an error because there are not enough observations within each class to estimate the large number of parameters in the \\(\\Sigma_k\\) matrices. This is less of a problem with LDA, since all observations, no matter the class, are being use to estimate the shared \\(\\Sigma\\) matrix. iris_qda_trn_pred = predict(iris_qda, iris_trn)$class iris_qda_tst_pred = predict(iris_qda, iris_tst)$class The predict() function operates the same as the predict() function for LDA. calc_class_err(predicted = iris_qda_trn_pred, actual = iris_trn$Species) ## [1] 0.01333333 calc_class_err(predicted = iris_qda_tst_pred, actual = iris_tst$Species) ## [1] 0.04 table(predicted = iris_qda_tst_pred, actual = iris_tst$Species) ## actual ## predicted setosa versicolor virginica ## setosa 22 0 0 ## versicolor 0 23 0 ## virginica 0 3 27 Here we find that QDA is not performing as well as LDA. It is misclassifying versicolors. Since QDA is a more complex model than LDA (many more parameters) we would say that QDA is overfitting here. Also note that, QDA creates quadratic decision boundaries, while LDA creates linear decision boundaries. We could also add quadratic terms to LDA to allow it to create quadratic decision boundaries. 11.3 Naive Bayes Naive Bayes comes in many forms. With only numeric predictors, it often assumes a multivariate normal conditioned on the classes, but a very specific multivariate normal. \\[ {\\mathbf X} \\mid Y = k \\sim N(\\mu_k, \\Sigma_k) \\] Naive Bayes assumes that the predictors \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p\\) are independent. This is the “naive” part of naive Bayes. The Bayes part is nothing new. Since \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p\\) are assumed independent, each \\(\\Sigma_k\\) is diagonal, that is, we assume no correlation between predictors. Independence implies zero correlation. This will allow us to write the (joint) likelihood as a product of univariate distributions. In this case, the product of univariate normal distributions instead of a (joint) multivariate distribution. \\[ f_k(x) = \\prod_{j = 1}^{j = p} f_{kj}(x_j) \\] Here, \\(f_{kj}(x_j)\\) is the density for the \\(j\\)-th predictor conditioned on the \\(k\\)-th class. Notice that there is a \\(\\sigma_{kj}\\) for each predictor for each class. \\[ f_{kj}(x_j) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{kj}\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x_j - \\mu_{kj}}{\\sigma_{kj}}\\right)^2\\right] \\] When \\(p = 1\\), this version of naive Bayes is equivalent to QDA. library(e1071) iris_nb = naiveBayes(Species ~ ., data = iris_trn) iris_nb ## ## Naive Bayes Classifier for Discrete Predictors ## ## Call: ## naiveBayes.default(x = X, y = Y, laplace = laplace) ## ## A-priori probabilities: ## Y ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 0.3733333 0.3200000 0.3066667 ## ## Conditional probabilities: ## Sepal.Length ## Y [,1] [,2] ## setosa 4.978571 0.3774742 ## versicolor 5.995833 0.5812125 ## virginica 6.669565 0.6392003 ## ## Sepal.Width ## Y [,1] [,2] ## setosa 3.378571 0.4349177 ## versicolor 2.808333 0.3269313 ## virginica 3.065217 0.3600615 ## ## Petal.Length ## Y [,1] [,2] ## setosa 1.432143 0.1743848 ## versicolor 4.254167 0.5166608 ## virginica 5.717391 0.5540366 ## ## Petal.Width ## Y [,1] [,2] ## setosa 0.2607143 0.1133310 ## versicolor 1.3333333 0.2334368 ## virginica 2.0956522 0.3022315 Many packages implement naive Bayes. Here we choose to use naiveBayes() from the package e1071. (The name of this package has an interesting history. Based on the name you wouldn’t know it, but the package contains many functions related to machine learning.) The Conditional probabilities: portion of the output gives the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution for each predictor in each class. Notice how these mean estimates match those for LDA and QDA above. Note that naiveBayes() will work without a factor response, but functions much better with one. (Especially when making predictions.) If you are using a 0 and 1 response, you might consider coercing to a factor first. head(predict(iris_nb, iris_trn)) ## [1] setosa virginica setosa setosa virginica setosa ## Levels: setosa versicolor virginica head(predict(iris_nb, iris_trn, type = &quot;class&quot;)) ## [1] setosa virginica setosa setosa virginica setosa ## Levels: setosa versicolor virginica head(predict(iris_nb, iris_trn, type = &quot;raw&quot;)) ## setosa versicolor virginica ## [1,] 1.000000e+00 3.134201e-16 2.948226e-27 ## [2,] 4.400050e-257 5.188308e-08 9.999999e-01 ## [3,] 1.000000e+00 2.263278e-14 1.168760e-24 ## [4,] 1.000000e+00 4.855740e-14 2.167253e-24 ## [5,] 1.897732e-218 6.189883e-08 9.999999e-01 ## [6,] 1.000000e+00 8.184097e-15 6.816322e-26 Oh look, predict() has another new mode of operation.

So why should we care about naive Bayes? The strength of naive Bayes comes from its ability to handle a large number of predictors, \\(p\\), even with a limited sample size \\(n\\). Even with the naive independence assumption, naive Bayes works rather well in practice. Also because of this assumption, we can often train naive Bayes where LDA and QDA may be impossible to train because of the large number of parameters relative to the number of observations. Here naive Bayes doesn’t get a chance to show its strength since LDA and QDA already perform well, and the number of predictors is low. The choice between LDA and QDA is mostly down to a consideration about the amount of complexity needed. 11.4 Discrete Inputs So far, we have assumed that all predictors are numeric. What happens with categorical predictors? iris_trn_mod = iris_trn iris_trn_mod$Sepal.Width = ifelse(iris_trn$Sepal.Width &gt; 3, ifelse(iris_trn$Sepal.Width &gt; 4, &quot;Large&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;), &quot;Small&quot;) unique(iris_trn_mod$Sepal.Width) ## [1] &quot;Medium&quot; &quot;Small&quot; &quot;Large&quot; Here we make a new dataset where Sepal.Width is categorical, with levels Small, Medium, and Large. We then try to train classifiers using only the sepal variables. naiveBayes(Species ~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width, data = iris_trn_mod) ## ## Naive Bayes Classifier for Discrete Predictors ## ## Call: ## naiveBayes.default(x = X, y = Y, laplace = laplace) ## ## A-priori probabilities: ## Y ## setosa versicolor virginica ## 0.3733333 0.3200000 0.3066667 ## ## Conditional probabilities: ## Sepal.Length ## Y [,1] [,2] ## setosa 4.978571 0.3774742 ## versicolor 5.995833 0.5812125 ## virginica 6.669565 0.6392003 ## ## Sepal.Width ## Y Large Medium Small ## setosa 0.07142857 0.67857143 0.25000000 ## versicolor 0.00000000 0.25000000 0.75000000 ## virginica 0.00000000 0.43478261 0.56521739 Naive Bayes makes a somewhat obvious and intelligent choice to model the categorical variable as a multinomial.

Not great, but better then not using a categorical variable. 11.5 rmarkdown The rmarkdown file for this chapter can be found here. The file was created using R version 3.4.2. The following packages (and their dependencies) were loaded when knitting this file: ## [1] &quot;e1071&quot; &quot;MASS&quot; "],
["knn-class.html", "Chapter 12 k-Nearest Neighbors 12.1 Binary Data Example 12.2 Categorical Data 12.3 External Links 12.4 rmarkdown", " Chapter 12 k-Nearest Neighbors In this chapter we introduce our first non-parametric classification method, \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors. So far, all of the methods for classificaiton that we have seen have been parametric. For example, logistic regression had the form \\[ \\log\\left(\\frac{p(x)}{1 - p(x)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_p x_p. \\] In this case, the \\(\\beta_j\\) are the parameters of the model, which we learned (estimated) by training (fitting) the model. Those estimates were then used to obtain estimates of the probability \\(p(x) = P(Y = 1 \\mid X = x)\\), \\[ \\hat{p}(x) = \\frac{e^{\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_1 + \\hat{\\beta}_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\hat{\\beta}_p x_p}}{1 + e^{\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_1 + \\hat{\\beta}_2 x_2 + \\cdots + \\hat{\\beta}_p x_p}} \\] As we saw in regression, \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors has no such model parameters. Instead, it has a tuning parameter, \\(k\\). This is a parameter which determines how the model is trained, instead of a parameter that is learned through training. Note that tuning parameters are not used exclusively with non-parametric methods. Later we will see examples of tuning parameters for parametric methods. Often when discussing \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors for classification, it is framed as a black-box method that directly returns classifications. We will instead frame it as a non-parametric model for the probabilites \\(p_g(x) = P(Y = g \\mid X = x)\\). That is a \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors model using \\(k\\) neighbors estimates this probability as \\[ \\hat{p}_{kg}(x) = \\hat{P}_k(Y = g \\mid X = x) = \\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{N}_k(x, \\mathcal{D})} I(y_i = g) \\] Essentially, the probability of each class \\(g\\) is the proportion of the \\(k\\) neighbors of \\(x\\) with that class, \\(g\\). Then, to create a classifier, as always, we simply classify to the class with the highest estimated probability. \\[ \\hat{C}_k(x) = \\underset{g}{\\mathrm{argmax}} \\ \\ \\hat{p}_{kg}(x) \\] This is the same as saying that we classify to the class with the most observations in the \\(k\\) nearest neighbors. If more than one class is tied for the highest estimated probablity, simply assign a class at random to one of the classes tied for highest. In the binary case this becomes \\[ \\hat{C}_k(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\hat{p}_{k0}(x) &gt; 0.5 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\hat{p}_{k1}(x) &lt; 0.5 \\end{cases} \\] Again, if the probability for class 0 and 1 are equal, simply assign at random. In the above example, when predicting at \\(x = (x_1, x_2) = (8, 6)\\), \\[ \\hat{p}_{5B}(x_1 = 8, x_2 = 6) = \\hat{P}_5(Y = \\text{Blue} \\mid X_1 = 8, X_2 = 6) = \\frac{3}{5} \\] \\[ \\hat{p}_{5O}(x_1 = 8, x_2 = 6) = \\hat{P}_5(Y = \\text{Orange} \\mid X_1 = 8, X_2 = 6) = \\frac{2}{5} \\] Thus \\[ \\hat{C}_5(x_1 = 8, x_2 = 6) = \\text{Blue} \\] 12.1 Binary Data Example library(ISLR) library(class) We first load some necessary libraries. We’ll begin discussing \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors for classification by returning to the Default data from the ISLR package. To perform \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors for classification, we will use the knn() function from the class package. Unlike many of our previous methods, such as logistic regression, knn() requires that all predictors be numeric, so we coerce student to be a 0 and 1 dummy variable instead of a factor. (We can, and should, leave the response as a factor.) Numeric predictors are required because of the distance calculations taking place. set.seed(42) Default$student = as.numeric(Default$student) - 1 default_idx = sample(nrow(Default), 5000) default_trn = Default[default_idx, ] default_tst = Default[-default_idx, ] Like we saw with knn.reg form the FNN package for regression, knn() from class does not utilize the formula syntax, rather, requires the predictors be their own data frame or matrix, and the class labels be a separate factor variable. Note that the y data should be a factor vector, not a data frame containing a factor vector. Note that the FNN package also contains a knn() function for classification. We choose knn() from class as it seems to be much more popular. However, you should be aware of which packages you have loaded and thus which functions you are using. They are very similar, but have some differences. # training data X_default_trn = default_trn[, -1] y_default_trn = default_trn$default # testing data X_default_tst = default_tst[, -1] y_default_tst = default_tst$default Again, there is very little “training” with \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors. Essentially the only training is to simply remember the inputs. Because of this, we say that \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors is fast at training time. However, at test time, \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors is very slow. For each test observation, the method must find the \\(k\\)-nearest neighbors, which is not computationally cheap. Note that by deafult, knn() uses Euclidean distance to determine neighbors. head(knn(train = X_default_trn, test = X_default_tst, cl = y_default_trn, k = 3)) ## [1] No No No No No No ## Levels: No Yes Because of the lack of any need for training, the knn() function immediately returns classifications. With logistic regression, we needed to use glm() to fit the model, then predict() to obtain probabilities we would use to make a classifier. Here, the knn() function directly returns classifications. That is knn() is essentially \\(\\hat{C}_k(x)\\). Here, knn() takes four arguments: train, the predictors for the train set. test, the predictors for the test set. knn() will output results (classifications) for these cases. cl, the true class labels for the train set. k, the number of neighbors to consider. calc_class_err = function(actual, predicted) { mean(actual != predicted) } We’ll use our usual calc_class_err() function to asses how well knn() works with this data. We use the test data to evaluate. calc_class_err(actual = y_default_tst, predicted = knn(train = X_default_trn, test = X_default_tst, cl = y_default_trn, k = 5)) ## [1] 0.0316 Often with knn() we need to consider the scale of the predictors variables. If one variable is contains much larger numbers because of the units or range of the variable, it will dominate other variables in the distance measurements. But this doesn’t necessarily mean that it should be such an important variable. It is common practice to scale the predictors to have a mean of zero and unit variance. Be sure to apply the scaling to both the train and test data. calc_class_err(actual = y_default_tst, predicted = knn(train = scale(X_default_trn), test = scale(X_default_tst), cl = y_default_trn, k = 5)) ## [1] 0.0278 Here we see the scaling slightly improves the classification accuracy. This may not always be the case, and often, it is normal to attempt classification with and without scaling. How do we choose \\(k\\)? Try different values and see which works best. set.seed(42) k_to_try = 1:100 err_k = rep(x = 0, times = length(k_to_try)) for (i in seq_along(k_to_try)) { pred = knn(train = scale(X_default_trn), test = scale(X_default_tst), cl = y_default_trn, k = k_to_try[i]) err_k[i] = calc_class_err(y_default_tst, pred) } The seq_along() function can be very useful for looping over a vector that stores non-consecutive numbers. It often removes the need for an additional counter variable. We actually didn’t need it in the above knn() example, but it is still a good habit. For example maybe we didn’t want to try every value of \\(k\\), but only odd integers, which woudl prevent ties. Or perhaps we’d only like to check multiples of 5 to further cut down on computation time. Also, note that we set a seed before running this loops. This is because we are considering even values of \\(k\\), thus, there are ties which are randomly broken. Naturally, we plot the \\(k\\)-nearest neighbor results. # plot error vs choice of k plot(err_k, type = &quot;b&quot;, col = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;, cex = 1, pch = 20, xlab = &quot;k, number of neighbors&quot;, ylab = &quot;classification error&quot;, main = &quot;(Test) Error Rate vs Neighbors&quot;) # add line for min error seen abline(h = min(err_k), col = &quot;darkorange&quot;, lty = 3) # add line for minority prevalence in test set abline(h = mean(y_default_tst == &quot;Yes&quot;), col = &quot;grey&quot;, lty = 2) The dotted orange line represents the smallest observed test classification error rate. min(err_k) ## [1] 0.0254 We see that five different values of \\(k\\) are tied for the lowest error rate. which(err_k == min(err_k)) ## [1] 11 17 20 21 22 Given a choice of these five values of \\(k\\), we select the largest, as it is the least variable, and has the least chance of overfitting. max(which(err_k == min(err_k))) ## [1] 22 Recall that defaulters are the minority class. That is, the majority of observations are non-defaulters. table(y_default_tst) ## y_default_tst ## No Yes ## 4835 165 Notice that, as \\(k\\) increases, eventually the error approaches the test prevalence of the minority class. mean(y_default_tst == &quot;Yes&quot;) ## [1] 0.033 12.2 Categorical Data Like LDA and QDA, KNN can be used for both binary and multi-class problems. As an example of a multi-class problems, we return to the iris data. set.seed(430) iris_obs = nrow(iris) iris_idx = sample(iris_obs, size = trunc(0.50 * iris_obs)) iris_trn = iris[iris_idx, ] iris_tst = iris[-iris_idx, ] All the predictors here are numeric, so we proceed to splitting the data into predictors and classes. # training data X_iris_trn = iris_trn[, -5] y_iris_trn = iris_trn$Species # testing data X_iris_tst = iris_tst[, -5] y_iris_tst = iris_tst$Species Like previous methods, we can obtain predicted probabilities given test predictors.

In the binary case, this would be sufficient to recover all probabilities, however, for multi-class problems, we cannot recover each of the probabilities of interest. This will simply be a minor annoyance for now, which we will fix when we introduce the caret package for model training. head(attributes(iris_pred)$prob, n = 50) ## [1] 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 ## [8] 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 ## [15] 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 ## [22] 1.0000000 0.9000000 1.0000000 0.8000000 1.0000000 0.9000000 0.9000000 ## [29] 0.9000000 0.8000000 1.0000000 0.9000000 1.0000000 0.8000000 0.5000000 ## [36] 0.8000000 0.9000000 0.8000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 0.7272727 0.9000000 ## [43] 0.8000000 0.9000000 1.0000000 1.0000000 0.9000000 0.9000000 0.9000000 ## [50] 0.7000000 12.3 External Links YouTube: \\(k\\)-Nearest Neighbor Classification Algorithm - Video from user “mathematicalmonk” which gives a brief but thorough introduction to the method. 12.4 rmarkdown The rmarkdown file for this chapter can be found here.

(This will actually happen inside the prcomp() function.) USArrests_pca = prcomp(USArrests, scale = TRUE) A large amount of information is stored in the output of prcomp(), some of which can neatly be displayed with summary(). names(USArrests_pca) ## [1] &quot;sdev&quot; &quot;rotation&quot; &quot;center&quot; &quot;scale&quot; &quot;x&quot; summary(USArrests_pca) ## Importance of components: ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 ## Standard deviation 1.5749 0.9949 0.59713 0.41645 ## Proportion of Variance 0.6201 0.2474 0.08914 0.04336 ## Cumulative Proportion 0.6201 0.8675 0.95664 1.00000 USArrests_pca$center ## Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape ## 7.788 170.760 65.540 21.232 USArrests_pca$scale ## Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape ## 4.355510 83.337661 14.474763 9.366385 USArrests_pca$rotation ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 ## Murder -0.5358995 0.4181809 -0.3412327 0.64922780 ## Assault -0.5831836 0.1879856 -0.2681484 -0.74340748 ## UrbanPop -0.2781909 -0.8728062 -0.3780158 0.13387773 ## Rape -0.5434321 -0.1673186 0.8177779 0.08902432 We see that $center and $scale give the mean and standard deviations for the original variables. $rotation gives the loading vectors that are used to rotate the original data to obtain the principal components. dim(USArrests_pca$x) ## [1] 50 4 dim(USArrests) ## [1] 50 4 head(USArrests_pca$x) ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 ## Alabama -0.9756604 1.1220012 -0.43980366 0.154696581 ## Alaska -1.9305379 1.0624269 2.01950027 -0.434175454 ## Arizona -1.7454429 -0.7384595 0.05423025 -0.826264240 ## Arkansas 0.1399989 1.1085423 0.11342217 -0.180973554 ## California -2.4986128 -1.5274267 0.59254100 -0.338559240 ## Colorado -1.4993407 -0.9776297 1.08400162 0.001450164 The dimension of the principal components is the same as the original data.

We see how the loadings obtain the principal components from the original data. We check that the loading vectors are normalized. We also check for orthogonality of both the loading vectors and the principal components. (Note the above inner products aren’t exactly 0, but that is simply a numerical issue.) biplot(USArrests_pca, scale = 0, cex = 0.5) A biplot can be used to visualize both the principal component scores and the principal component loadings. (Note the two scales for each axis.) USArrests_pca$sdev ## [1] 1.5748783 0.9948694 0.5971291 0.4164494 USArrests_pca$sdev ^ 2 / sum(USArrests_pca$sdev ^ 2) ## [1] 0.62006039 0.24744129 0.08914080 0.04335752 Frequently we will be interested in the proportion of variance explained by a principal component. get_PVE = function(pca_out) { pca_out$sdev ^ 2 / sum(pca_out$sdev ^ 2) } So frequently, we would be smart to write a function to do so. pve = get_PVE(USArrests_pca) pve ## [1] 0.62006039 0.24744129 0.08914080 0.04335752 plot( pve, xlab = &quot;Principal Component&quot;, ylab = &quot;Proportion of Variance Explained&quot;, ylim = c(0, 1), type = &#39;b&#39; ) We can then plot the proportion of variance explained for each PC. As expected, we see the PVE decrease. cumsum(pve) ## [1] 0.6200604 0.8675017 0.9566425 1.0000000 plot( cumsum(pve), xlab = &quot;Principal Component&quot;, ylab = &quot;Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained&quot;, ylim = c(0, 1), type = &#39;b&#39; ) Often we are interested in the cumulative proportion. A common use of PCA outside of visualization is dimension reduction for modeling. If \\(p\\) is large, PCA is performed, and the principal components that account for a large proportion of variation, say 95%, are used for further analysis. In certain situations that can reduce the dimensionality of data significantly. This can be done almost automatically using caret: library(caret) library(mlbench) data(Sonar) set.seed(18) using_pca = train(Class ~ ., data = Sonar, method = &quot;knn&quot;, trControl = trainControl(method = &quot;cv&quot;, number = 5), preProcess = &quot;pca&quot;, tuneGrid = expand.grid(k = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9))) regular_scaling = train(Class ~ ., data = Sonar, method = &quot;knn&quot;, trControl = trainControl(method = &quot;cv&quot;, number = 5), preProcess = c(&quot;center&quot;, &quot;scale&quot;), tuneGrid = expand.grid(k = c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9))) max(using_pca$results$Accuracy) ## [1] 0.8656997 max(regular_scaling$results$Accuracy) ## [1] 0.8609378 using_pca$preProcess ## Created from 208 samples and 60 variables ## ## Pre-processing: ## - centered (60) ## - ignored (0) ## - principal component signal extraction (60) ## - scaled (60) ## ## PCA needed 30 components to capture 95 percent of the variance It won’t always outperform simply using the original predictors, but here using 30 of 60 principal components shows a slight advantage over using all 60 predictors. In other situation, it may result in a large perform gain. 13.2.2 Simulated Data library(MASS) set.seed(42) n = 180 p = 10 clust_data = rbind( mvrnorm(n = n / 3, sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4), p, replace = TRUE), diag(p)), mvrnorm(n = n / 3, sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4), p, replace = TRUE), diag(p)), mvrnorm(n = n / 3, sample(c(1, 2, 3, 4), p, replace = TRUE), diag(p)) ) Above we simulate data for clustering. Note that, we did this in a way that will result in three clusters. true_clusters = c(rep(3, n / 3), rep(1, n / 3), rep(2, n / 3)) We label the true clusters 1, 2, and 3 in a way that will “match” output from \\(k\\)-means. (Which is somewhat arbitrary.) kmean_out = kmeans(clust_data, centers = 3, nstart = 10) names(kmean_out) ## [1] &quot;cluster&quot; &quot;centers&quot; &quot;totss&quot; &quot;withinss&quot; ## [5] &quot;tot.withinss&quot; &quot;betweenss&quot; &quot;size&quot; &quot;iter&quot; ## [9] &quot;ifault&quot; Notice that we used nstart = 10 which will give us a more stable solution by attempting 10 random starting positions for the means. Also notice we chose to use centers = 3. (The \\(k\\) in \\(k\\)-mean). How did we know to do this? We’ll find out on the homework. (It will involve looking at tot.withinss) kmean_out ## K-means clustering with 3 clusters of sizes 61, 60, 59 ## ## Cluster means: ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] ## 1 3.997352 4.085592 0.7846534 2.136643 4.059886 3.2490887 1.747697 ## 2 1.008138 2.881229 4.3102354 4.094867 3.022989 0.8878413 4.002270 ## 3 3.993468 4.049505 1.9553560 4.037748 2.825907 2.9960855 3.026397 ## [,8] [,9] [,10] ## 1 1.8341976 0.8193371 4.043725 ## 2 3.8085492 2.0905060 0.977065 ## 3 0.8992179 3.0041820 2.931030 ## ## Clustering vector: ## [1] 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ## [36] 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## [71] 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ## [106] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ## [141] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ## [176] 2 2 2 2 2 ## ## Within cluster sum of squares by cluster: ## [1] 609.2674 581.8780 568.3845 ## (between_SS / total_SS = 54.0 %) ## ## Available components: ## ## [1] &quot;cluster&quot; &quot;centers&quot; &quot;totss&quot; &quot;withinss&quot; ## [5] &quot;tot.withinss&quot; &quot;betweenss&quot; &quot;size&quot; &quot;iter&quot; ## [9] &quot;ifault&quot; kmeans_clusters = kmean_out$cluster table(true_clusters, kmeans_clusters) ## kmeans_clusters ## true_clusters 1 2 3 ## 1 58 0 2 ## 2 0 60 0 ## 3 3 0 57 We check how well the clustering is working. dim(clust_data) ## [1] 180 10 This data is “high dimensional” so it is difficult to visualize. (Anything more than 2 is hard to visualize.) plot( clust_data[, 1], clust_data[, 2], pch = 20, xlab = &quot;First Variable&quot;, ylab = &quot;Second Variable&quot; ) Plotting the first and second variables simply results in a blob. plot( clust_data[, 1], clust_data[, 2], col = true_clusters, pch = 20, xlab = &quot;First Variable&quot;, ylab = &quot;Second Variable&quot; ) Even when using their true clusters for coloring, this plot isn’t very helpful. clust_data_pca = prcomp(clust_data, scale = TRUE) plot( clust_data_pca$x[, 1], clust_data_pca$x[, 2], pch = 0, xlab = &quot;First Principal Component&quot;, ylab = &quot;Second Principal Component&quot; ) If we instead plot the first two principal components, we see, even without coloring, one blob that is clearly separate from the rest. plot( clust_data_pca$x[, 1], clust_data_pca$x[, 2], col = true_clusters, pch = 0, xlab = &quot;First Principal Component&quot;, ylab = &quot;Second Principal Component&quot;, cex = 2 ) points(clust_data_pca$x[, 1], clust_data_pca$x[, 2], col = kmeans_clusters, pch = 20, cex = 1.5) Now adding the true colors (boxes) and the \\(k\\)-means results (circles), we obtain a nice visualization. clust_data_pve = get_PVE(clust_data_pca) plot( cumsum(clust_data_pve), xlab = &quot;Principal Component&quot;, ylab = &quot;Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained&quot;, ylim = c(0, 1), type = &#39;b&#39; ) The above visualization works well because the first two PCs explain a large proportion of the variance. #install.packages(&#39;sparcl&#39;) library(sparcl) To create colored dendrograms we will use ColorDendrogram() in the sparcl package. clust_data_hc = hclust(dist(scale(clust_data)), method = &quot;complete&quot;) clust_data_cut = cutree(clust_data_hc , 3) ColorDendrogram(clust_data_hc, y = clust_data_cut, labels = names(clust_data_cut), main = &quot;Simulated Data, Complete Linkage&quot;, branchlength = 1.5) Here we apply hierarchical clustering to the scaled data. The dist() function is used to calculate pairwise distances between the (scaled in this case) observations. We use complete linkage. We then use the cutree() function to cluster the data into 3 clusters. The ColorDendrogram() function is then used to plot the dendrogram. Note that the branchlength argument is somewhat arbitrary (the length of the colored bar) and will need to be modified for each dendrogram. table(true_clusters, clust_data_cut) ## clust_data_cut ## true_clusters 1 2 3 ## 1 9 51 0 ## 2 1 0 59 ## 3 59 1 0 We see in this case hierarchical clustering doesn’t “work” as well as \\(k\\)-means. clust_data_hc = hclust(dist(scale(clust_data)), method = &quot;single&quot;) clust_data_cut = cutree(clust_data_hc , 3) ColorDendrogram(clust_data_hc, y = clust_data_cut, labels = names(clust_data_cut), main = &quot;Simulated Data, Single Linkage&quot;, branchlength = 0.5) table(true_clusters, clust_data_cut) ## clust_data_cut ## true_clusters 1 2 3 ## 1 59 1 0 ## 2 59 0 1 ## 3 60 0 0 clust_data_hc = hclust(dist(scale(clust_data)), method = &quot;average&quot;) clust_data_cut = cutree(clust_data_hc , 3) ColorDendrogram(clust_data_hc, y = clust_data_cut, labels = names(clust_data_cut), main = &quot;Simulated Data, Average Linkage&quot;, branchlength = 1) table(true_clusters, clust_data_cut) ## clust_data_cut ## true_clusters 1 2 3 ## 1 1 59 0 ## 2 1 0 59 ## 3 58 2 0 We also try single and average linkage.

The Bias-Variance Tradeoff As model complexity increases, bias decreases. As model complexity increases, variance increases. As a result, there is a model somewhere in the middle with the best accuracy. (Or lowest RMSE for regression.) The Test-Train Split Never use test data to train a model. Test accuracy is a measure of how well a method works in general. We can identify underfitting and overfitting models relative to the best test accuracy. A less complex model than the model with the best test accuracy is underfitting. A more complex model than the model with the best test accuracy is overfitting. Classification Methods Logistic Regression Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) Naive Bayes (NB) \\(k\\)-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) For each, we can: Obtain predicted probabilities. Make classifications. Find decision boundaries. (Seen only for some.) Discriminative versus Generative Methods Discriminative methods learn the conditional distribution \\(p(y \\mid x)\\), thus could only simulate \\(y\\) given a fixed \\(x\\). Generative methods learn the joint distribution \\(p(x, y)\\), thus could only simulate new data \\((x, y)\\). Parametric and Non-Parametric Methods Parametric methods models \\(P[Y = k \\mid X = x]\\) as a specific function of parameters which are learned through data. Non-Parametric use an algorithmic approach to estimate \\(P[Y = k \\mid X = x]\\) for each possible input \\(x\\). Tuning Parameters Specify how to train a model. This in contrast to model parameters, which are learned through training. Cross-Validation A method to estimate test metrics with training data. Repeats the train-validate split inside the training data. Curse of Dimensionality As feature space grows, that is as \\(p\\) grows, “neighborhoods” must become much larger to contain “neighbors,” thus local methods are not so local.

Some methods, for example glm() through boot::cv.glm() and knn() through knn.cv() have cross-validation capabilities built-in. We’ll use glm() for illustration. First we need to convince ourselves that glm() can be used to perform the same tasks as lm(). data(Auto, package = &quot;ISLR&quot;) glm_fit = glm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto) coef(glm_fit) ## (Intercept) horsepower ## 39.9358610 -0.1578447 lm_fit = lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto) coef(lm_fit) ## (Intercept) horsepower ## 39.9358610 -0.1578447 By default, cv.glm() will report leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). glm_fit = glm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto) loocv_rmse = sqrt(boot::cv.glm(Auto, glm_fit)$delta) sqrt(loocv_rmse) ## [1] 2.218682 2.218674 sqrt(loocv_rmse[1]) ## [1] 2.218682 We are actually given two values. The first is exactly the LOOCV-RMSE. The second is a minor correction that we will not worry about. We take a square root to obtain LOOCV-RMSE. loocv_rmse_poly = rep(0, times = 10) for (i in seq_along(loocv_rmse_poly)) { glm_fit = glm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, i), data = Auto) loocv_rmse_poly[i] = sqrt(boot::cv.glm(Auto, glm_fit)$delta[1]) } loocv_rmse_poly ## [1] 4.922552 4.387279 4.397156 4.407316 4.362707 4.356449 4.339706 ## [8] 4.354440 4.366764 4.414854 plot(loocv_rmse_poly, type = &quot;b&quot;, col = &quot;dodgerblue&quot;, main = &quot;LOOCV-RMSE vs Polynomial Degree&quot;, ylab = &quot;LOOCV-RMSE&quot;, xlab = &quot;Polynomial Degree&quot;) If you run the above code locally, you will notice that is painfully slow. We are fitting each of the 10 models 392 times, that is, each model \\(n\\) times, once with each data point left out. (Note: in this case, for a linear model, there is actually a shortcut formula which would allow us to obtain LOOCV-RMSE from a single fit to the data. See details in ISL as well as a link below.)

(Spoiler: This is not true, but let’s pretend it is, so we can see how to perform cross-validation from scratch.) This essentially amounts to randomly splitting the data, then looping over the splits.

If for no other reason, it gives us a quick sanity check that we have cross-validated correctly. To be specific we will test-train split the data, then perform cross-validation within the training data. calc_err = function(actual, predicted) { mean(actual != predicted) } # simulate data # y is 0/1 # X are independent N(0,1) variables # X has no relationship with the response # p &gt;&gt;&gt; n set.seed(430) n = 400 p = 5000 X = replicate(p, rnorm(n)) y = c(rbinom(n = n, size = 1, prob = 0.5)) # first n/2 observations are used for training # last n/2 observations used for testing # both are 50% 0s and 50% 1s # cv will be done inside train data full_data = data.frame(y, X) trn_idx = sample(1:nrow(full_data), trunc(nrow(full_data) * 0.5)) trn_data = full_data[trn_idx, ] tst_data = full_data[-trn_idx, ] First, we use the screen-then-validate approach. # find correlation between y and each predictor variable correlations = apply(trn_data[, -1], 2, cor, y = trn_data$y) hist(correlations) # select the 25 largest (absolute) correlation # these should be &quot;useful&quot; for prediction selected = order(abs(correlations), decreasing = TRUE)[1:25] correlations[selected] ## X2717 X32 X2665 X2371 X4611 X3573 ## 0.2716135 0.2547580 -0.2536404 0.2530664 -0.2466395 0.2428334 ## X1701 X4116 X1653 X1024 X3334 X3094 ## 0.2329670 -0.2297586 -0.2195325 -0.2174270 0.2162564 -0.2124802 ## X2327 X3491 X2299 X4900 X2078 X941 ## -0.2110879 0.2108721 -0.2099112 -0.2073970 0.2069720 0.2055869 ## X320 X2680 X4204 X3820 X1619 X3438 ## 0.2051092 -0.2048960 -0.2043215 -0.2001827 -0.1996106 -0.1985622 ## X115 ## -0.1969733 # subset the test and training data based on the selected predictors trn_screen = trn_data[c(1, selected)] tst_screen = tst_data[c(1, selected)] # fit an additive logistic regression # use 10-fold cross-validation to obtain an estimate of test accuracy # horribly optimistic glm_fit = glm(y ~ ., data = trn_screen, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) boot::cv.glm(trn_screen, glm_fit, K = 10)$delta[1] ## [1] 0.284542 # get test accuracy, which we expect to be 0.50 # no better than guessing glm_pred = (predict(glm_fit, newdata = tst_screen, type = &quot;response&quot;) &gt; 0.5) * 1 calc_err(predicted = glm_pred, actual = tst_screen$y) ## [1] 0.545 Now, we will correctly screen-while-validating. # use the caret package to obtain 10 &quot;folds&quot; folds = caret::createFolds(trn_data$y, k = 10) # for each fold # - pre-screen variables on the 9 training folds # - fit model to these variables # - get accuracy on validation fold fold_err = rep(0, length(folds)) for (i in seq_along(folds)) { # split for fold i trn_fold = trn_data[-folds[[i]],] val_fold = trn_data[folds[[i]],] # screening for fold i correlations = apply(trn_fold[, -1], 2, cor, y = trn_fold[,1]) selected = order(abs(correlations), decreasing = TRUE)[1:25] trn_fold_screen = trn_fold[ ,c(1,selected)] val_fold_screen = val_fold[ ,c(1,selected)] # accuracy for fold i glm_fit = glm(y ~ ., data = trn_fold_screen, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) glm_pred = (predict(glm_fit, newdata = val_fold_screen, type = &quot;response&quot;) &gt; 0.5) * 1 fold_err[i] = mean(glm_pred == val_fold_screen$y) } # report all 10 validation fold accuracies fold_err ## [1] 0.40 0.35 0.45 0.50 0.45 0.30 0.60 0.55 0.60 0.75 # properly cross-validated error # this roughly matches what we expect in the test set mean(fold_err) ## [1] 0.495 20.3 Bootstrap ISL discusses the bootstrap, which is another resampling method. However, it is less relevant to the statistical learning tasks we will encounter. It could be used to replace cross-validation, but encounters significantly more computation. It could be more useful if we were to attempt to calculate the bias and variance of a prediction (estimate) without access to the data generating process. Return to the bias-variance tradeoff chapter and think about how the bootstrap could be used to obtain estimates of bias and variance with a single dataset, instead of repeated simulated datasets. 20.4 External Links YouTube: Cross-Validation, Part 1 - Video from user “mathematicalmonk” which introduces \\(K\\)-fold cross-validation in greater detail.

Hopefully it will be added later. Now that we have seen a number of classification (and regression) methods, and introduced cross-validation, we see the general outline of a predictive analysis: Select a method Test-train split the available data Decide on a set of candidate models via tuning parameters Select the “best model” (chose the values of the tuning parameters) using a cross-validated metric with the training data Use chosen model to make predictions Calculate relevant metrics on the test data At face value it would seem like it should be easy to repeat this process for a number of different methods, however we have run into a number of difficulties attempting to do so with R. The predict() function seems to have a different behavior for each new method we see. Many methods have different cross-validation functions, or worse yet, no built-in process for cross-validation. Not all methods expect the same data format. Some methods do not use formula syntax. Different methods have different handling of categorical predictors. Thankfully, the R community has essentially provided a silver bullet for these issues, the caret package. Returning to the above list, we will see that a number of these tasks are directly addressed in the caret package. Test-train split the available data createDataPartition() will take the place of our manual data splitting. It will also do some extra work to ensure that the train and test samples are somewhat similar. Decide on a set of candidate models via tuning parameters expand.grid() is not a function in caret, but we will get in the habit of using it to specify a grid of tuning parameters. Select the best model (tuning parameters) using a cross-validated metric trainControl() will setup cross-validation train() is the workhorse of caret. It takes the following information then trains the requested model: form, a formula, such as y ~ . data, the data used for training method, a statistical learning method from a long list of availible models preProcess which allows for specification of data pre-processing such as centering and scaling tuneGrid which specifies the tuning parameters to train over trControl which specifies the resampling scheme, that is, how cross-validation should be performed to find the best values of the tuning parameters Use chosen model to make predictions predict() used on objects of type train will be truly magical! To illustrate caret, we will use the Default data from the ISLR package. data(Default, package = &quot;ISLR&quot;) library(caret) We first test-train split the data using createDataPartition. Here we are using 75% of the data for training. set.seed(430) default_idx = createDataPartition(Default$default, p = 0.75, list = FALSE) default_trn = Default[default_idx, ] default_tst = Default[-default_idx, ] TODO: Why are we specifying the response? (createDataPartition tries to create similiar distributions in the train and test sets.) default_glm = train( form = default ~ ., data = default_trn, method = &quot;glm&quot;, family = &quot;binomial&quot;, trControl = trainControl(method = &quot;cv&quot;, number = 5) ) default_glm ## Generalized Linear Model ## ## 7501 samples ## 3 predictor ## 2 classes: &#39;No&#39;, &#39;Yes&#39;

We will use the Hitters dataset from the ISLR package to explore two shrinkage methods: ridge and lasso.

Also, note that that ridge regression is not scale invariant like the usual unpenalized regression. Thankfully, glmnet() takes care of this internally. It automatically standardizes input for fitting, then reports fitted coefficient using the original scale. The two plots illustrate how much the coefficients are penalized for different values of \\(\\lambda\\). Notice none of the coefficients are forced to be zero. fit_ridge = glmnet(X, y, alpha = 0) plot(fit_ridge) plot(fit_ridge, xvar = &quot;lambda&quot;, label = TRUE) dim(coef(fit_ridge)) ## [1] 20 100 We use cross-validation to select a good \\(\\lambda\\) value. The cv.glmnet()function uses 10 folds by default. The plot illustrates the MSE for the \\(\\lambda\\)s considered. Two lines are drawn. The first is the \\(\\lambda\\) that gives the smallest MSE. The second is the \\(\\lambda\\) that gives an MSE within one standard error of the smallest. fit_ridge_cv = cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = 0) plot(fit_ridge_cv) The cv.glmnet() function returns several details of the fit for both \\(\\lambda\\) values in the plot.

Like lasso and ridge, the intercept is not penalized and glment takes care of standardization internally. Also reported coefficients are on the original scale. The new penalty is \\(\\frac{\\lambda \\cdot (1-\\alpha)}{2}\\) times the ridge penalty plus \\(\\lambda \\cdot \\alpha\\) times the lasso lasso penalty. (Dividing the ridge penalty by 2 is a mathematical convenience for optimization.) Essentially, with the correct choice of \\(\\lambda\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) these two “penalty coefficients” can be any positive numbers. Often it is more useful to simply think of \\(\\alpha\\) as controlling the mixing between the two penalties and \\(\\lambda\\) controlling the amount of penalization. \\(\\alpha\\) takes values between 0 and 1. Using \\(\\alpha = 1\\) gives the lasso that we have seen before. Similarly, \\(\\alpha = 0\\) gives ridge. We used these two before with glmnet() to specify which to method we wanted. Now we also allow for \\(\\alpha\\) values in between. set.seed(430) cv_5 = trainControl(method = &quot;cv&quot;, number = 5) We first setup our cross-validation strategy, which will be 5 fold. We then use train() with method = &quot;glmnet&quot; which is actually fitting the elastic net. hit_elnet = train( Salary ~ ., data = Hitters, method = &quot;glmnet&quot;, trControl = cv_5 ) First, note that since we are using caret() directly, it is taking care of dummy variable creation. So unlike before when we used glmnet(), we do not need to manually create a model matrix. Also note that we have allowed caret to choose the tuning parameters for us. hit_elnet ## glmnet ## ## 263 samples ## 19 predictor ## ## No pre-processing ## Resampling: Cross-Validated (5 fold) ## Summary of sample sizes: 210, 211, 210, 211, 210 ## Resampling results across tuning parameters: ## ## alpha lambda RMSE Rsquared MAE ## 0.10 0.5106 340.7 0.4463 242.4 ## 0.10 5.1056 340.5 0.4441 241.2 ## 0.10 51.0564 344.7 0.4329 237.3 ## 0.55 0.5106 340.3 0.4468 242.1 ## 0.55 5.1056 341.2 0.4426 239.3 ## 0.55 51.0564 346.0 0.4345 238.6 ## 1.00 0.5106 339.9 0.4475 241.7 ## 1.00 5.1056 342.2 0.4400 237.9 ## 1.00 51.0564 355.4 0.4162 246.3 ## ## RMSE was used to select the optimal model using the smallest value. ## The final values used for the model were alpha = 1 and lambda = 0.5106. Notice a few things with these results. First, we have tried three \\(\\alpha\\) values, 0.1, 0.55, and 1. It is not entirely clear why caret doesn’t use 0. It likely uses 0.1 to fit a model close to ridge, but with some potential for sparsity. Here, the best result uses \\(\\alpha = 0.55\\), so this result is somewhere between ridge and lasso. hit_elnet_int = train( Salary ~ . ^ 2, data = Hitters, method = &quot;glmnet&quot;, trControl = cv_5, tuneLength = 10 ) Now we try a much larger model search. First, we’re expanding the feature space to include all interactions. Since we are using penalized regression, we don’t have to worry as much about overfitting. If many of the added variables are not useful, we will likely use a model close to lasso which makes many of them 0. We’re also using a larger tuning grid. By setting tuneLength = 10, we will search 10 \\(\\alpha\\) values and 10 \\(\\lambda\\) values for each. Because of this larger tuning grid, the results will be very large. To deal with this, we write a quick helper function to extract the row with the best tuning parameters. get_best_result = function(caret_fit) { best_result = caret_fit$results[as.numeric(rownames(caret_fit$bestTune)), ] rownames(best_result) = NULL best_result } We then call this function on the trained object. get_best_result(hit_elnet_int) ## alpha lambda RMSE Rsquared MAE RMSESD RsquaredSD MAESD ## 1 1 4.135 295.5 0.5808 196.8 50 0.1525 11.49 We see that the best result uses \\(\\alpha = 1\\), which makes since. With \\(\\alpha = 1\\), many of the added interaction coefficients are likely set to zero. (Unfortunately, obtaining this information after using caret with glmnet isn’t easy. The two don’t actually play very nice together. We’ll use cv.glmnet() with the expanded feature space to explore this.) Also, this CV-RMSE is better than the lasso and ridge from the previous chapter that did not use the expanded feature space. We also perform a quick analysis using cv.glmnet() instead. Due in part to randomness in cross validation, and differences in how cv.glmnet() and train() search for \\(\\lambda\\), the results are slightly different. set.seed(430) X = model.matrix(Salary ~ . ^ 2, Hitters)[, -1] y = Hitters$Salary fit_lasso_cv = cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = 1) sqrt(fit_lasso_cv$cvm[fit_lasso_cv$lambda == fit_lasso_cv$lambda.min]) # CV-RMSE minimum ## [1] 304.1 The commented line is not run, since it produces a lot of output, but if run, it will show that the fast majority of the coefficients are zero! (Also, you’ll notice that cv.glmnet() does not respect the usual predictor hierarchy. Not a problem for prediction, but a massive interpretation issue!) #coef(fit_lasso_cv) 25.3 Elastic Net for Classification Above, we have performed a regression task. But like lasso and ridge, elastic net can also be used for classification by using the deviance instead of the residual sum of squares. This essentially happens automatically in caret if the response variable is a factor. We’ll test this using the familiar Default dataset, which we first test-train split. data(Default, package = &quot;ISLR&quot;) set.seed(430) default_idx = createDataPartition(Default$default, p = 0.75, list = FALSE) default_trn = Default[default_idx, ] default_tst = Default[-default_idx, ] We then fit an elastic net with a default tuning grid. def_elnet = train( default ~ ., data = default_trn, method = &quot;glmnet&quot;, trControl = cv_5 ) def_elnet ## glmnet ## ## 7501 samples ## 3 predictor ## 2 classes: &#39;No&#39;, &#39;Yes&#39; ## ## No pre-processing ## Resampling: Cross-Validated (5 fold) ## Summary of sample sizes: 6001, 6001, 6000, 6001, 6001 ## Resampling results across tuning parameters: ## ## alpha lambda Accuracy Kappa ## 0.10 0.0001242 0.9733 0.40751 ## 0.10 0.0012424 0.9727 0.36354 ## 0.10 0.0124239 0.9676 0.07718 ## 0.55 0.0001242 0.9732 0.40600 ## 0.55 0.0012424 0.9724 0.36841 ## 0.55 0.0124239 0.9684 0.12506 ## 1.00 0.0001242 0.9732 0.40600 ## 1.00 0.0012424 0.9727 0.38095 ## 1.00 0.0124239 0.9689 0.15170 ## ## Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value. ## The final values used for the model were alpha = 0.1 and lambda ## = 0.0001242.

We will use type = class to directly obtain classes. We first fit the tree using the training data (above), then obtain predictions on both the train and test set, then view the confusion matrix for both. seat_trn_pred = predict(seat_tree, seat_trn, type = &quot;class&quot;) seat_tst_pred = predict(seat_tree, seat_tst, type = &quot;class&quot;) #predict(seat_tree, seat_trn, type = &quot;vector&quot;) #predict(seat_tree, seat_tst, type = &quot;vector&quot;) # train confusion table(predicted = seat_trn_pred, actual = seat_trn$Sales) ## actual ## predicted High Low ## High 66 10 ## Low 14 110 # test confusion table(predicted = seat_tst_pred, actual = seat_tst$Sales) ## actual ## predicted High Low ## High 57 29 ## Low 27 87 accuracy = function(actual, predicted) { mean(actual == predicted) } # train acc accuracy(predicted = seat_trn_pred, actual = seat_trn$Sales) ## [1] 0.88 # test acc accuracy(predicted = seat_tst_pred, actual = seat_tst$Sales) ## [1] 0.72 Here it is easy to see that the tree has been over-fit. The train set performs much better than the test set. We will now use cross-validation to find a tree by considering trees of different sizes which have been pruned from our original tree. set.seed(3) seat_tree_cv = cv.tree(seat_tree, FUN = prune.misclass) # index of tree with minimum error min_idx = which.min(seat_tree_cv$dev) min_idx ## [1] 5 # number of terminal nodes in that tree seat_tree_cv$size[min_idx] ## [1] 9 # misclassification rate of each tree seat_tree_cv$dev / length(seat_idx) ## [1] 0.275 0.275 0.265 0.260 0.250 0.280 0.345 0.325 0.400 par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) # default plot plot(seat_tree_cv) # better plot plot(seat_tree_cv$size, seat_tree_cv$dev / nrow(seat_trn), type = &quot;b&quot;, xlab = &quot;Tree Size&quot;, ylab = &quot;CV Misclassification Rate&quot;) It appears that a tree of size 9 has the fewest misclassifications of the considered trees, via cross-validation. We use prune.misclass() to obtain that tree from our original tree, and plot this smaller tree. seat_tree_prune = prune.misclass(seat_tree, best = 9) summary(seat_tree_prune) ## ## Classification tree: ## snip.tree(tree = seat_tree, nodes = c(223L, 4L, 12L, 54L)) ## Variables actually used in tree construction: ## [1] &quot;ShelveLoc&quot; &quot;Price&quot; &quot;Advertising&quot; &quot;Age&quot; &quot;CompPrice&quot; ## Number of terminal nodes: 9 ## Residual mean deviance: 0.8103 = 154.8 / 191 ## Misclassification error rate: 0.155 = 31 / 200 plot(seat_tree_prune) text(seat_tree_prune, pretty = 0) title(main = &quot;Pruned Classification Tree&quot;) We again obtain predictions using this smaller tree, and evaluate on the test and train sets. # train seat_prune_trn_pred = predict(seat_tree_prune, seat_trn, type = &quot;class&quot;) table(predicted = seat_prune_trn_pred, actual = seat_trn$Sales) ## actual ## predicted High Low ## High 59 10 ## Low 21 110 accuracy(predicted = seat_prune_trn_pred, actual = seat_trn$Sales) ## [1] 0.845 # test seat_prune_tst_pred = predict(seat_tree_prune, seat_tst, type = &quot;class&quot;) table(predicted = seat_prune_tst_pred, actual = seat_tst$Sales) ## actual ## predicted High Low ## High 60 22 ## Low 24 94 accuracy(predicted = seat_prune_tst_pred, actual = seat_tst$Sales) ## [1] 0.77 The train set has performed almost as well as before, and there was a small improvement in the test set, but it is still obvious that we have over-fit. Trees tend to do this. We will look at several ways to fix this, including: bagging, boosting and random forests. 26.2 Regression Trees To demonstrate regression trees, we will use the Boston data. Recall medv is the response. We first split the data in half. library(MASS) set.seed(18) boston_idx = sample(1:nrow(Boston), nrow(Boston) / 2) boston_trn = Boston[boston_idx,] boston_tst = Boston[-boston_idx,] Then fit an unpruned regression tree to the training data. boston_tree = tree(medv ~ ., data = boston_trn) summary(boston_tree) ## ## Regression tree: ## tree(formula = medv ~ ., data = boston_trn) ## Variables actually used in tree construction: ## [1] &quot;rm&quot; &quot;lstat&quot; &quot;crim&quot; ## Number of terminal nodes: 9 ## Residual mean deviance: 12.35 = 3013 / 244 ## Distribution of residuals: ## Min. 1st Qu.

Max. ## -13.600 -1.832 -0.120 0.000 1.348 26.350 plot(boston_tree) text(boston_tree, pretty = 0) title(main = &quot;Unpruned Regression Tree&quot;) As with classification trees, we can use cross-validation to select a good pruning of the tree. set.seed(18) boston_tree_cv = cv.tree(boston_tree) plot(boston_tree_cv$size, sqrt(boston_tree_cv$dev / nrow(boston_trn)), type = &quot;b&quot;, xlab = &quot;Tree Size&quot;, ylab = &quot;CV-RMSE&quot;) While the tree of size 9 does have the lowest RMSE, we’ll prune to a size of 7 as it seems to perform just as well. (Otherwise we would not be pruning.) The pruned tree is, as expected, smaller and easier to interpret. boston_tree_prune = prune.tree(boston_tree, best = 7) summary(boston_tree_prune) ## ## Regression tree: ## snip.tree(tree = boston_tree, nodes = c(11L, 8L)) ## Variables actually used in tree construction: ## [1] &quot;rm&quot; &quot;lstat&quot; &quot;crim&quot; ## Number of terminal nodes: 7 ## Residual mean deviance: 14.05 = 3455 / 246 ## Distribution of residuals: ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu.

We also plot actual vs predicted. This plot may look odd. We’ll compare it to a plot for linear regression below. # training RMSE two ways sqrt(summary(boston_tree_prune)$dev / nrow(boston_trn)) ## [1] 3.695598 boston_prune_trn_pred = predict(boston_tree_prune, newdata = boston_trn) rmse(boston_prune_trn_pred, boston_trn$medv) ## [1] 3.695598 # test RMSE boston_prune_tst_pred = predict(boston_tree_prune, newdata = boston_tst) rmse(boston_prune_tst_pred, boston_tst$medv) ## [1] 5.331457 plot(boston_prune_tst_pred, boston_tst$medv, xlab = &quot;Predicted&quot;, ylab = &quot;Actual&quot;) abline(0, 1) Here, using an additive linear regression the actual vs predicted looks much more like what we are used to. bostom_lm = lm(medv ~ ., data = boston_trn) boston_lm_pred = predict(bostom_lm, newdata = boston_tst) plot(boston_lm_pred, boston_tst$medv, xlab = &quot;Predicted&quot;, ylab = &quot;Actual&quot;) abline(0, 1) rmse(boston_lm_pred, boston_tst$medv) ## [1] 5.125877 We also see a lower test RMSE. The most obvious linear regression beats the tree! Again, we’ll improve on this tree soon. Also note the summary of the additive linear regression below.

It is much more feature rich, including fitting multiple cost complexities and performing cross-validation by default. It also has the ability to produce much nicer trees. Based on its default settings, it will often result in smaller trees than using the tree package. See the references below for more information. rpart can also be tuned via caret. library(rpart) set.seed(430) # Fit a decision tree using rpart # Note: when you fit a tree using rpart, the fitting routine automatically # performs 10-fold CV and stores the errors for later use # (such as for pruning the tree) # fit a tree using rpart seat_rpart = rpart(Sales ~ ., data = seat_trn, method = &quot;class&quot;) # plot the cv error curve for the tree # rpart tries different cost-complexities by default # also stores cv results plotcp(seat_rpart) # find best value of cp min_cp = seat_rpart$cptable[which.min(seat_rpart$cptable[,&quot;xerror&quot;]),&quot;CP&quot;] min_cp ## [1] 0.02083333 # prunce tree using best cp seat_rpart_prune = prune(seat_rpart, cp = min_cp) # nicer plots library(rpart.plot) prp(seat_rpart_prune) prp(seat_rpart_prune, type = 4) rpart.plot(seat_rpart_prune) 26.4 External Links An Introduction to Recursive Partitioning Using the rpart Routines - Details of the rpart package. rpart.plot Package - Detailed manual on plotting with rpart using the rpart.plot package. 26.5 RMarkdown The RMarkdown file for this chapter can be found here.

We will use RMSE as our metric, so we write a function which will help us along the way. rmse = function(actual, predicted) { sqrt(mean((actual - predicted) ^ 2)) } We also load all of the packages that we will need. library(tree) library(MASS) library(ISLR) library(randomForest) library(gbm) library(caret) We first test-train split the data and fit the same pruned tree as before. (Note: When pruning the tree, the best tree is actually the unpruned tree. View the results of cv.tree to see this. However, we select the tree of size 7 as the best of the pruned trees.) set.seed(18) boston_idx = sample(1:nrow(Boston), nrow(Boston) / 2) boston_trn = Boston[boston_idx,] boston_tst = Boston[-boston_idx,] 27.1.1 Tree Model boston_tree = tree(medv ~ ., data = boston_trn) set.seed(18) boston_tree_cv = cv.tree(boston_tree) boston_tree_prune = prune.tree(boston_tree, best = 7) boston_prune_tst_pred = predict(boston_tree_prune, newdata = boston_tst) plot(boston_prune_tst_pred, boston_tst$medv, xlab = &quot;Predicted&quot;, ylab = &quot;Actual&quot;, main = &quot;Predicted vs Actual: Tree, Test Data&quot;) abline(0, 1, col = &quot;red&quot;, lwd = 2) (tree_tst_rmse = rmse(boston_prune_tst_pred, boston_tst$medv)) ## [1] 5.331457 27.1.2 Linear Model Last time, we also fit an additive linear model, which we found to work better than the tree. The test RMSE is lower, and the predicted vs actual plot looks much better. bostom_lm = lm(medv ~ ., data = boston_trn) boston_lm_tst_pred = predict(bostom_lm, newdata = boston_tst) plot(boston_lm_tst_pred, boston_tst$medv, xlab = &quot;Predicted&quot;, ylab = &quot;Actual&quot;, main = &quot;Predicted vs Actual: Linear Model, Test Data&quot; ) abline(0, 1, col = &quot;red&quot;, lwd = 2) (lm_tst_rmse = rmse(boston_lm_tst_pred, boston_tst$medv)) ## [1] 5.125877 27.1.3 Bagging We now fit a bagged model, using the randomForest package. Bagging is actually a special case of a random forest where mtry is equal to \\(p\\), the number of predictors. boston_bag = randomForest(medv ~ ., data = boston_trn, mtry = 13, importance = TRUE, ntrees = 500) boston_bag ## ## Call: ## randomForest(formula = medv ~ ., data = boston_trn, mtry = 13, importance = TRUE, ntrees = 500) ## Type of random forest: regression ## Number of trees: 500 ## No. of variables tried at each split: 13 ## ## Mean of squared residuals: 14.20299 ## % Var explained: 80.92 boston_bag_tst_pred = predict(boston_bag, newdata = boston_tst) plot(boston_bag_tst_pred,boston_tst$medv, xlab = &quot;Predicted&quot;, ylab = &quot;Actual&quot;, main = &quot;Predicted vs Actual: Bagged Model, Test Data&quot; ) abline(0, 1, col = &quot;red&quot;, lwd = 2) (bag_tst_rmse = rmse(boston_bag_tst_pred, boston_tst$medv)) ## [1] 3.814368 Here we see two interesting results. First, the predicted versus actual plot no longer has a small number of predicted values. Second, our test error has dropped dramatically. Also note that the “Mean of squared residuals” which is output by randomForest is the Out of Bag estimate of the error. plot(boston_bag) 27.1.4 Random Forest We now try a random forest. For regression, the suggestion is to use mtry equal to \\(p/3\\). boston_forest = randomForest(medv ~ ., data = boston_trn, mtry = 4, importance = TRUE, ntrees = 500) boston_forest ## ## Call: ## randomForest(formula = medv ~ ., data = boston_trn, mtry = 4, importance = TRUE, ntrees = 500) ## Type of random forest: regression ## Number of trees: 500 ## No. of variables tried at each split: 4 ## ## Mean of squared residuals: 12.80737 ## % Var explained: 82.79 #importance(boston_forest) #varImpPlot(boston_forest) boston_forest_tst_pred = predict(boston_forest, newdata = boston_tst) plot(boston_forest_tst_pred, boston_tst$medv, xlab = &quot;Predicted&quot;, ylab = &quot;Actual&quot;, main = &quot;Predicted vs Actual: Random Forest, Test Data&quot; ) abline(0, 1, col = &quot;red&quot;, lwd = 2) (forest_tst_rmse = rmse(boston_forest_tst_pred, boston_tst$medv)) ## [1] 3.73447 boston_forest_trn_pred = predict(boston_forest, newdata = boston_trn) forest_trn_rmse = rmse(boston_forest_trn_pred, boston_trn$medv) forest_oob_rmse = rmse(boston_forest$predicted, boston_trn$medv) Here we note three RMSEs. The training RMSE (which is optimistic), the OOB RMSE (which is a good estimate of the test error) and the test RMSE.

We see that an additive logistic regression performs much better than a single tree, but we expect ensemble methods to bring trees closer to the logistic regression. Can they do better? We now use prediction accuracy as our metric: accuracy = function(actual, predicted) { mean(actual == predicted) } data(Carseats) Carseats$Sales = as.factor(ifelse(Carseats$Sales &lt;= 8, &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;High&quot;)) set.seed(2) seat_idx = sample(1:nrow(Carseats), 200) seat_trn = Carseats[seat_idx,] seat_tst = Carseats[-seat_idx,] 27.2.1 Tree Model seat_tree = tree(Sales ~ ., data = seat_trn) set.seed(3) seat_tree_cv = cv.tree(seat_tree, FUN = prune.misclass) seat_tree_prune = prune.misclass(seat_tree, best = 9) seat_prune_tst_pred = predict(seat_tree_prune, seat_tst, type = &quot;class&quot;) table(predicted = seat_prune_tst_pred, actual = seat_tst$Sales) ## actual ## predicted High Low ## High 60 22 ## Low 24 94 (tree_tst_acc = accuracy(predicted = seat_prune_tst_pred, actual = seat_tst$Sales)) ## [1] 0.77 27.2.2 Logistic Regression seat_glm = glm(Sales ~ ., data = seat_trn, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) seat_glm_tst_pred = ifelse(predict(seat_glm, seat_tst, &quot;response&quot;) &gt; 0.5, &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;High&quot;) table(predicted = seat_glm_tst_pred, actual = seat_tst$Sales) ## actual ## predicted High Low ## High 75 9 ## Low 9 107 (glm_tst_acc = accuracy(predicted = seat_glm_tst_pred, actual = seat_tst$Sales)) ## [1] 0.91 27.2.3 Bagging seat_bag = randomForest(Sales ~ ., data = seat_trn, mtry = 10, importance = TRUE, ntrees = 500) seat_bag ## ## Call: ## randomForest(formula = Sales ~ ., data = seat_trn, mtry = 10, importance = TRUE, ntrees = 500) ## Type of random forest: classification ## Number of trees: 500 ## No. of variables tried at each split: 10 ## ## OOB estimate of error rate: 21.5% ## Confusion matrix: ## High Low class.error ## High 51 29 0.3625000 ## Low 14 106 0.1166667 seat_bag_tst_pred = predict(seat_bag, newdata = seat_tst) table(predicted = seat_bag_tst_pred, actual = seat_tst$Sales) ## actual ## predicted High Low ## High 68 21 ## Low 16 95 (bag_tst_acc = accuracy(predicted = seat_bag_tst_pred, actual = seat_tst$Sales)) ## [1] 0.815 27.2.4 Random Forest For classification, the suggested mtry for a random forest is \\(\\sqrt{p}.\\) seat_forest = randomForest(Sales ~ ., data = seat_trn, mtry = 3, importance = TRUE, ntrees = 500) seat_forest ## ## Call: ## randomForest(formula = Sales ~ ., data = seat_trn, mtry = 3, importance = TRUE, ntrees = 500) ## Type of random forest: classification ## Number of trees: 500 ## No. of variables tried at each split: 3 ## ## OOB estimate of error rate: 22% ## Confusion matrix: ## High Low class.error ## High 49 31 0.3875000 ## Low 13 107 0.1083333 seat_forest_tst_perd = predict(seat_forest, newdata = seat_tst) table(predicted = seat_forest_tst_perd, actual = seat_tst$Sales) ## actual ## predicted High Low ## High 63 16 ## Low 21 100 (forest_tst_acc = accuracy(predicted = seat_forest_tst_perd, actual = seat_tst$Sales)) ## [1] 0.815 27.2.5 Boosting To perform boosting, we modify the response to be 0 and 1 to work with gbm. Later we will use caret to fit gbm models, which will avoid this annoyance. seat_trn_mod = seat_trn seat_trn_mod$Sales = as.numeric(ifelse(seat_trn_mod$Sales == &quot;Low&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;)) seat_boost = gbm(Sales ~ ., data = seat_trn_mod, distribution = &quot;bernoulli&quot;, n.trees = 5000, interaction.depth = 4, shrinkage = 0.01) seat_boost ## gbm(formula = Sales ~ ., distribution = &quot;bernoulli&quot;, data = seat_trn_mod, ## n.trees = 5000, interaction.depth = 4, shrinkage = 0.01) ## A gradient boosted model with bernoulli loss function. ## 5000 iterations were performed. ## There were 10 predictors of which 10 had non-zero influence. seat_boost_tst_pred = ifelse(predict(seat_boost, seat_tst, n.trees = 5000, &quot;response&quot;) &gt; 0.5, &quot;High&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;) table(predicted = seat_boost_tst_pred, actual = seat_tst$Sales) ## actual ## predicted High Low ## High 70 17 ## Low 14 99 (boost_tst_acc = accuracy(predicted = seat_boost_tst_pred, actual = seat_tst$Sales)) ## [1] 0.845 27.2.6 Results (seat_acc = data.frame( Model = c(&quot;Single Tree&quot;, &quot;Logistic Regression&quot;, &quot;Bagging&quot;, &quot;Random Forest&quot;, &quot;Boosting&quot;), TestAccuracy = c(tree_tst_acc, glm_tst_acc, bag_tst_acc, forest_tst_acc, boost_tst_acc) ) ) ## Model TestAccuracy ## 1 Single Tree 0.770 ## 2 Logistic Regression 0.910 ## 3 Bagging 0.815 ## 4 Random Forest 0.815 ## 5 Boosting 0.845 Here we see each of the ensemble methods performing better than a single tree, however, they still fall behind logistic regression. Sometimes a simple linear model will beat more complicated models! This is why you should always try a logistic regression for classification. 27.3 Tuning So far we fit bagging, boosting and random forest models, but did not tune any of them, we simply used certain, somewhat arbitrary, parameters. Now we will see how to modify the tuning parameters to make these models better. Bagging: Actually just a subset of Random Forest with mtry = \\(p\\). Random Forest: mtry Boosting: n.trees, interaction.depth, shrinkage, n.minobsinnode We will use the caret package to accomplish this. Technically ntrees is a tuning parameter for both bagging and random forest, but caret will use 500 by default and there is no easy way to tune it. This will not make a big difference since for both we simply need “enough” and 500 seems to do the trick. While mtry is a tuning parameter, there are suggested values for classification and regression: Regression: mtry = \\(p/3.\\) Classification: mtry = \\(\\sqrt{p}.\\) Also note that with these tree-based ensemble methods there are two resampling solutions for tuning the model: Out of Bag Cross-Validation Using Out of Bag samples is advantageous with these methods as compared to Cross-Validation since it removes the need to refit the model and is thus much more computationally efficient. Unfortunately OOB methods cannot be used with gbm models. See the caret documentation for details. 27.3.1 Random Forest and Bagging Here we setup training control for both OOB and cross-validation methods. Note we specify verbose = FALSE which suppresses output related to progress. You may wish to set this to TRUE when first tuning a model since it will give you an idea of how long the tuning process will take. (Which can sometimes be a long time.) oob = trainControl(method = &quot;oob&quot;) cv_5 = trainControl(method = &quot;cv&quot;, number = 5) To tune a Random Forest in caret we will use method = &quot;rf&quot; which uses the randomForest function in the background. Here we elect to use the OOB training control that we created. We could also use Cross-Validation, however it will likely select a similar model, but requiring more time. We setup a grid of mtry values which include all possible values since there are \\(10\\) predictors in the dataset. An mtry of \\(10\\) is actually bagging. dim(seat_trn) ## [1] 200 11 rf_grid = expand.grid(mtry = 1:10) set.seed(825) seat_rf_tune = train(Sales ~ ., data = seat_trn, method = &quot;rf&quot;, trControl = oob, verbose = FALSE, tuneGrid = rf_grid) seat_rf_tune ## Random Forest ## ## 200 samples ## 10 predictor ## 2 classes: &#39;High&#39;, &#39;Low&#39; ## ## No pre-processing ## Resampling results across tuning parameters: ## ## mtry Accuracy Kappa ## 1 0.730 0.3807339 ## 2 0.775 0.5033113 ## 3 0.795 0.5591398 ## 4 0.790 0.5474138 ## 5 0.795 0.5610278 ## 6 0.790 0.5512821 ## 7 0.805 0.5806452 ## 8 0.795 0.5628998 ## 9 0.785 0.5376344 ## 10 0.775 0.5202559 ## ## Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value. ## The final value used for the model was mtry = 7. accuracy(predict(seat_rf_tune, seat_tst), seat_tst$Sales) ## [1] 0.795 The results returned are based on the OOB samples. (Coincidentally, the test accuracy is the same as the best accuracy found using OOB samples.) Note that when using OOB, for some reason the default plot is not what you would expect and is not at all useful. (Which is why it is omitted here.) seat_rf_tune$bestTune ## mtry ## 7 7 Based on these results, we would select the random forest model with an mtry of 7. Note that based on the OOB estimates, the bagging model is expected to perform worse than this select model, however, based on our results above, that is not what we find to be true in our test set. Also note that method = &quot;ranger&quot; would also fit a random forest model. Ranger is a newer R package for random forests that has been shown to be much faster, especially when there are a larger number of predictors. 27.3.2 Boosting We now tune a boosted tree model. We will use the cross-validation tune control setup above. We will fit the model using gbm with caret. To setup the tuning grid, we must specify four parameters to tune: interaction.depth: How many splits to use with each tree. n.trees: The number of trees to use. shrinkage: The shrinkage parameters, which controls how fast the method learns. n.minobsinnode: The minimum number of observations in a node of the tree. (caret requires us to specify this. This is actually a tuning parameter of the trees, not boosting, and we would normally just accept the default.) Finally, expand.grid comes in handy, as we can specify a vector of values for each parameter, then we get back a matrix of all possible combinations. gbm_grid = expand.grid(interaction.depth = 1:5, n.trees = (1:6) * 500, shrinkage = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1), n.minobsinnode = 10) We now train the model using all possible combinations of the tuning parameters we just specified. seat_gbm_tune = train(Sales ~ ., data = seat_trn, method = &quot;gbm&quot;, trControl = cv_5, verbose = FALSE, tuneGrid = gbm_grid) The additional verbose = FALSE in the train call suppresses additional output from each gbm call. By default, calling plot here will produce a nice graphic of the results. #seat_gbm_tune plot(seat_gbm_tune) accuracy(predict(seat_gbm_tune, seat_tst), seat_tst$Sales) ## [1] 0.845 We see our tuned model does no better on the test set than the arbitrary boosted model we had fit above, with the slightly different parameters seen below. We could perhaps try a larger tuning grid, but at this point it seems unlikely that we could find a much better model. There seems to be no way to get a tree method to out-perform logistic regression in this dataset. seat_gbm_tune$bestTune ## n.trees interaction.depth shrinkage n.minobsinnode ## 61 500 1 0.1 10 27.4 Tree versus Ensemble Boundaries library(mlbench) set.seed(42) sim_trn = mlbench.circle(n = 1000, d = 2) sim_trn = data.frame(sim_trn$x, class = as.factor(sim_trn$classes)) sim_tst = mlbench.circle(n = 1000, d = 2) sim_tst = data.frame(sim_tst$x, class = as.factor(sim_tst$classes)) plot(sim_trn$X1, sim_trn$X2, col = sim_trn$class, xlab = &quot;X1&quot;, ylab = &quot;X2&quot;) cv_5 = trainControl(method = &quot;cv&quot;, number = 5) oob = trainControl(method = &quot;oob&quot;) sim_tree_cv = train(class ~ ., data = sim_trn, trControl = cv_5, method = &quot;rpart&quot;) library(rpart.plot) prp(sim_tree_cv$finalModel) rf_grid = expand.grid(mtry = c(1, 2)) sim_rf_oob = train(class ~ ., data = sim_trn, trControl = oob, tuneGrid = rf_grid) gbm_grid = expand.grid(interaction.depth = 1:5, n.trees = (1:6) * 500, shrinkage = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.1), n.minobsinnode = 10) sim_gbm_cv = train(class ~ ., data = sim_trn, method = &quot;gbm&quot;, trControl = cv_5, verbose = FALSE, tuneGrid = gbm_grid) plot_grid = expand.grid( X1 = seq(min(sim_tst$X1), max(sim_tst$X1), by = 0.01), X2 = seq(min(sim_tst$X2), max(sim_tst$X2), by = 0.01) ) tree_pred = predict(sim_tree_cv, plot_grid) rf_pred = predict(sim_rf_oob, plot_grid) gbm_pred = predict(sim_gbm_cv, plot_grid) par(mfrow = c(1, 3)) plot(plot_grid$X1, plot_grid$X2, col = tree_pred, xlab = &quot;X1&quot;, ylab = &quot;X2&quot;, pch = 20, main = &quot;Single Tree&quot;) plot(plot_grid$X1, plot_grid$X2, col = rf_pred, xlab = &quot;X1&quot;, ylab = &quot;X2&quot;, pch = 20, main = &quot;Random Forest&quot;) plot(plot_grid$X1, plot_grid$X2, col = gbm_pred, xlab = &quot;X1&quot;, ylab = &quot;X2&quot;, pch = 20, main = &quot;Boosted Trees&quot;) 27.5 External Links Classification and Regression by randomForest - Introduction to the randomForest package in R news. ranger: A Fast Implementation of Random Forests - Alternative package for fitting random forests with potentially better speed.
