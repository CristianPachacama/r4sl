    - note how cv follows test
    - add error bars?
-TODO: plot which shows how CV follows test. see here: http://www.milanor.net/blog/cross-validation-for-predictive-analytics-using-r/


- TODO: consider further chaptering, probably a good idea

## Bootstrap

- TODO: sim data
    - use repeated sims to estimate var of a prediction
    - what if only had one simulated dataset (sample) boostrap
    - plot hist of simulated preds, plot hist of boostrapped preds
