# Logistic Regression


- how linear regression makes sense mean(0/1 @ x) ~~ prob, but isn't limited to (0,1)
    - how coercion to 0/1 from factor works
    
- add something about bayes rule, and how we are directly optimizing towards?


    
- how to read the "usual" logistic regression plot (which isn't a great plot)
    - note how ISL illustrates proportion at each x

- how probabilities create classifications
    - how chaning usual cutoff usually lowers acc, but changes sens and spec, possible for better
    - ROC curve?

- confounding example from slides
- multiple

- >2 outcomes
    - only show how to do in `R`
    - note its coming from a NN package
    - will discuss later
